## Architecture

### Technology Stack
```
Frontend Layer (Your Application)
    ↓
Flask REST API (Python)
    ↓
├─ Sentence Transformers (Embeddings)
├─ FAISS (Vector Search)
├─ OpenAI GPT-4 (Summarization)
└─ Document Processing (DOCX, CSV)
    ↓
Knowledge Base (Pre-processed SDG Documents)
```

### Data Flow
1. **Indexing Phase** (Done once):
   - Documents → Text Extraction → Chunking → Embedding → FAISS Index
   
2. **Query Phase** (Runtime):
   - User Query → Embedding → FAISS Search → Context Retrieval → GPT Summary → Response

### Key Models

**Embedding Models (Ensemble Approach)**:
- Primary: `all-mpnet-base-v2` (70% weight) - Better for policy/government text
- Secondary: `multi-qa-mpnet-base-dot-v1` (30% weight) - Better for Q&A tasks
- **Why Ensemble?** Combines strengths of both models for more robust semantic understanding

**Language Model**:
- `GPT-4o` via OpenAI API
- Temperature: 0.3 (balanced between creativity and consistency)
- Used for generating structured policy summaries

---

## Core Components

### 1. Document Preprocessing

**Input Documents** (from your notebook):
- PDF reports (`.pdf`)
- Word documents (`.docx`)
- PowerPoint presentations (`.pptx`)
- CSV/Excel data tables (`.csv`, `.xlsx`)

**Chunking Strategy**:
```python
max_tokens = 250 words per chunk
overlap_sentences = 2 (context preservation)
```

**Why Chunking?**
- LLMs have token limits
- Improves retrieval precision
- Preserves context through overlap

**Metadata Stored Per Chunk**:
- `chunk_id`: Unique identifier
- `file_name`: Source document
- `theme`: SDG category
- `chunk_text`: Actual content
- `chunk_length`: Word count
- `has_numbers`, `has_percentages`, `has_years`: Content flags
- `has_sdg_keywords`: Relevance indicator

### 2. Vector Search (FAISS)

**FAISS Index Type**: `IndexFlatIP` (Inner Product)
- Exact search (not approximate)
- Optimized for normalized vectors
- Fast for datasets < 1M vectors

**Search Algorithm**:
1. Query → Embedding (both models)
2. Search FAISS index with both embeddings
3. Combine results with weighted scoring (70/30 split)
4. Deduplicate by chunk_id
5. Sort by combined score
6. Return top-k results

### 3. GPT Summarization

**Prompt Engineering**:
The system uses a structured prompt with:
- **Context**: Retrieved document chunks with source citations
- **Requirements**: UN-style policy language, evidence-based analysis
- **Structure**: Title, Executive Summary, Introduction, Body, Conclusion, References
- **Constraints**: 1000 words, no invention, citation required

**Output Format**:
- Professional policy brief (2-3 pages)
- Footnote-style citations [1], [2], etc.
- Thematic sections based on evidence
- SDG alignment analysis

---

## API Endpoints

      "score_primary": 0.85,                  // Relevance from primary model
      "score_enhanced": 0.82,                 // Relevance from secondary model
      "combined_score": 0.841,                // Weighted average (70/30)
      "idx": 123                              // Index in FAISS
    }
  ]
}
```

**Real-World Scenarios**:

1. **Quick Evidence Lookup**:

   - Find official data and context

**Best Practices**:
- Keep queries specific (3-10 words)
- Include context keywords (location, timeframe, sector)
- Start with k=10, increase if results insufficient
- Combine multiple searches for comprehensive coverage

---

### 3. Generate Summary

**Endpoint**: `POST /generate_summary`

**Purpose**: Generate comprehensive policy brief on a development challenge using GPT-4

**Request Body**:
```json
{
  "challenge": "string",  // Development challenge to analyze
  "k": 30                 // Number of source chunks to use (optional, default: 30)
}
```

**Variables Explained**:
- `challenge`: Full description of the development issue (e.g., "Limited access to quality primary healthcare and unequal distribution of health workers")
- `k`: Number of document chunks to retrieve as evidence. Recommended: 20-40 for comprehensive analysis

**Processing Time**: 20-60 seconds (depends on k and GPT-4 availability)

**Response**:
```json
{
  "challenge": "Limited access to quality primary healthcare...",
  "summary": "**TITLE**\nStrengthening Primary Health Care in Albania...\n\n**EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**\n...",
  "sources_count": 30
}
```

3. **Introduction**: Strategic relevance and context
4. **Main Body**: Evidence-based analysis with citations
   - Root causes
   - Impact on vulnerable groups
   - Stakeholder roles
   - Financial considerations
   - Interconnections with other SDGs
5. **Conclusion**: Synthesis and forward-looking implications
6. **References**: Footnoted sources [1], [2], etc.

**Real-World Scenarios**:

1. **UN Common Country Assessment (CCA)**:
   - UNDP preparing country analysis
   - Generate summaries for all identified development challenges
   - Use as foundation for CCA document

2. **Ministry Policy Brief**:
   - Health Ministry needs evidence for budget allocation
   - Challenge: "Maternal mortality in remote areas"
   - Summary provides data-driven justification

3. **Donor Proposal**:
   - NGO applying for EU funding
   - Challenge: "Digital divide in public services"
   - Use summary as problem statement section

4. **Parliamentary Report**:
   - Legislative committee investigating education quality
   - Challenge: "Low enrollment in early childhood education"
   - Summary synthesizes multi-source evidence

**Optimization Tips**:
- For quick overviews: k=10-15 (faster, less comprehensive)
- For detailed briefs: k=30-50 (slower, more evidence)
- Test different k values to find quality/speed balance
- Cache results for frequently analyzed challenges

---

### 4. Generate Indicators

**Endpoint**: `POST /generate_indicators`

**Purpose**: Extract measurable indicators for monitoring development progress

**Request Body**:
```json
{
  "challenge": "string",  // Development challenge
  "k": 20,                // Source chunks for extraction (optional, default: 20)
  "top_k": 5              // Number of indicators to return (optional, default: 5)
}
```

**Variables Explained**:
- `challenge`: The development issue to measure
- `k`: How many chunks to analyze for indicator extraction
- `top_k`: Number of indicators in final matrix (typically 5-10)

**Response**:
```json
{
  "challenge": "High youth unemployment...",
  "indicators": [
    {
      "indicator": "Youth Unemployment Rate",
      "purpose": "This indicator measures progress on high youth unemployment...",
      "data_sources": "WHO / National Statistical Office / World Bank",
      "measurement_frequency": "Annual",
      "relevance_to_sdg": "SDG Target TBD"
    }
  ]
}
```

**How It Works**:
1. Retrieve k relevant chunks
2. Extract phrases matching pattern: `word(s) + (rate|ratio|index|level|score|coverage|prevalence|incidence)`
3. Deduplicate and rank by frequency
4. Return top_k indicators with metadata

**Real-World Scenarios**:

1. **M&E Framework Development**:
   - Project manager designing monitoring system
   - Challenge: "Gender-based economic exclusion"
   - Use indicators to populate logical framework matrix

   - Challenge: "Water resource management"
   - Indicators guide local target-setting

3. **Baseline Study Design**:
   - Research institute conducting impact evaluation
   - Challenge: "Social protection coverage"
   - Indicators inform data collection instruments

4. **Dashboard Development**:
   - Tech team building SDG monitoring dashboard
   - Challenge: "Environmental degradation"
   - Indicators define dashboard metrics

**Limitations**:
- Extraction is pattern-based (may miss unconventional indicators)
- Data sources are generic placeholders (manual verification needed)
- SDG targets marked as "TBD" (requires expert mapping)

**Enhancement Recommendations**:
- Manually review and refine extracted indicators
- Validate against official SDG indicator framework
- Add baseline values and targets
- Specify geographic disaggregation requirements

  "challenges": [        // Array of development challenges
    "Challenge 1 description",
    "Challenge 2 description",
    "Challenge 3 description"
  ],
  "k": 30               // Source chunks per challenge (optional, default: 30)
}
```

**Variables Explained**:
- `challenges`: List of development issues to analyze (array of strings)
- `k`: Number of chunks used for each challenge's summary and indicators

**Processing Time**: (20-60 seconds) × number of challenges

**Response**:
```json
{
  "results": [
    {
      "challenge": "Challenge 1 description",
      "summary": "**TITLE**...",
      "indicators": [...],
      "status": "success"
    },
    {
      "challenge": "Challenge 2 description",
      "summary": "**TITLE**...",
      "indicators": [...],
      "status": "success"
    },
    {
      "challenge": "Challenge 3 description",
      "status": "error",
      "error": "Rate limit exceeded"
    }
  ]
}
```

4. **Overnight Batch Jobs**:
   - Research team with large analysis workload
   - Input: 50+ development challenges
   - Schedule batch overnight
   - Output: Complete analytical dataset by morning

**Error Handling**:
- Individual challenge failures don't stop entire batch
- Each result has `status` field (success/error)
- Errors include descriptive message for debugging
- Successful results returned even if some fail

**Optimization Strategies**:
- Split very large batches (>20 challenges) to avoid timeouts
- Lower k value for faster processing (trade-off: less comprehensive)
- Monitor OpenAI API rate limits
- Implement retry logic for transient failures
