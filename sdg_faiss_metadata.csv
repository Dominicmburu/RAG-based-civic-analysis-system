The sample frame used for the QLFS is based on data of Enumeration Areas according to the Housing and Population Census of 2023. The sample size for the fourth quarter of 2024 is 7917 households. The sample is based in a two-stage sampling procedure. In the second stage are selected the geographical areas with a proportional probability to the size of the enumeration area. In the second stage within each of the geographical areas (once selected in the second stage) are selected a fix number of households by equal probability systematic sampling method. The QLFS uses a rotational sampling design, whereby a household once initially selected for interview, is retained in the sample for five consecutive quarters. The same household is scheduled to be interviewed exactly after 13 weeks apart, so that the fifth interview takes place one year after the second. In the fourth quarter of 2024, the household response rate was 75.3 %. Data collection in the fieldwork is spread during all months of the year.

CONTEXT Following the first Intergovernmental Conference on accession negotiations on 19 July 2022, the screening sessions for all six clusters were completed on 24 November 2023. In the context of accession negotiations, Albania submitted the three roadmaps that will guide its reforms efforts. Albania continued to implement the Stabilisation and Association Agreement, and the joint bodies under the agreement met. An intergovernmental conference was convened in October 2024 to open accession negotiations on cluster 1 - fundamentals. The firm political commitment of the Albanian authorities to the strategic goal of European Union integration has been consistently stated as the country’s key priority, and a high level of ambition to move forward in the accession negotiations has been generally maintained. The ongoing accession negotiation process needs to lead to an acceleration of EU-related reforms. Albania maintained its record of full alignment with the EU’s common foreign and security policy. During its term as a non-permanent member of the UN Security Council between 2022 and 2023, Albania actively engaged as a co-penholder of resolutions condemning Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine, aligning with the EU position, including on restrictive measures and sanctions against Russia.

Albania’s stance sends a strong signal of its strategic choice of EU accession and of its role as a reliable partner. Albania has actively engaged in the implementation of the new Growth Plan for the Western Balkans across the four pillars of gradual integration with the EU single market, regional economic integration, fundamental reforms and increased financial support. The Reform Agenda covers reforms in the areas of: (i) business environment; (ii) human capital; (iii) digitalisation; (iv) energy and green transition; and (v) fundamental rights and the rule of law. The Commission’s 2024 rule of law report2 covered Albania for the first time. 1.2.

It is based on input from a variety of sources, including contributions from the government of Albania, EU Member States, European Parliament reports and information from various international and non-governmental organisations. It also includes the results of comparative assessments and indices produced by other stakeholders, in particular in the area of rule of law. The report uses the following assessment scale to describe the state of play: early stage, some level of preparation, moderately prepared, good level of preparation and well advanced. To describe progress made during the reporting period, it uses the following scale: backsliding, no progress, limited progress, some progress, good progress and very good progress.

Economy and Employment/Economy and Employment,Albania EU Report 2024.pdf,8,Albania EU Report 2024.pdf_chunk8,"Parliament can exercise its powers in a mostly satisfactory way. However, its oversight over the executive remains limited. Parliament’s activity was affected by continuous clashes between the ruling majority and a part of the opposition between October 2023 and March 2024. These reflected a lack of constructive and inclusive political dialogue and resulted in opposition MPs causing disruptions due to alleged restrictions on their rights. Despite the welcome return to the normal functioning of Parliament in March 2024, political polarisation remains high. This continues to negatively impact Parliament’s key legislative and oversight roles and extends delays in appointing individuals to key positions. Albania’s bodies in charge of the integration process are in place. These EU integration structures were further consolidated and successfully completed the screening process in November 2023. EU integration expertise, planning and interinstitutional mechanisms will need to be strengthened to be able to cope with the EU accession process. The government needs to intensify its efforts to engage in public communication on EU integration. The government continued to show its commitment to EU integration. Three waves of governmental changes occurred during the reporting period.

The division of responsibilities between local and central government remains a concern. Efforts are still needed to improve local government units’ financial resources, administrative capacity and fiscal autonomy. Civil society organisations (CSOs) in Albania operate in a challenging environment, including in relation to registration requirements and limited public funding for CSOs. The role of civil society, including in the EU accession negotiation process, should be further strengthened. The structures in place for consulting civil society need to be reinforced and become fully operational. In addition, the conditions necessary for effective VAT exemption need to be put in place without further delay. Public administration reform Albania remains moderately prepared in the area of public administration reform (PAR). It made limited progress in delivering on last year’s recommendations. A new position of Minister of State for Public Administration and Anti-Corruption was created in January 2024, which provides a clear political leadership for the PAR agenda and should improve the overall coordination of the reform efforts. The new Public Financial Management (PFM) Strategy for the period 2023-2030 was adopted in June 2024, and a new National Anti-Fraud strategy will be adopted by end 2024.

The CO provides comprehensive guidance to navigate economic reforms, enhance regional co-operation and help the region’s economies align their legal frameworks and policies with those of the OECD and EU. It also enables policy makers to track performance over time, by comparing outcomes against those reported in the previous editions since 2016. The CO 2024 comprises seven reports: one regional and six economy profiles. Each economy profile evaluates performance across each of the 15 policy dimensions, highlighting areas of progress as well as those requiring continued improvement. The regional profile presents findings for the whole Western Balkans across five policy clusters - infrastructure and connectivity, skills, business environment, digital transformation and greening - and seeks to evaluate the broader regional trends in these areas. Complementing these reports, the publication’s findings are accessible for the first time through a landmark interactive digital tool: the Western Balkans Competitiveness Data Hub.",229,True,False,True,False,0.0

Complementing these reports, the publication’s findings are accessible for the first time through a landmark interactive digital tool: the Western Balkans Competitiveness Data Hub. By providing policy makers with an enhanced ability to assess and benchmark economic reforms seamlessly, the Data Hub aims to support policy makers in designing economic reforms that drive competitiveness and convergence. The Albania profile of the CO is the outcome of work co-ordinated by the South East Europe Division. The assessment was conducted under the guidance of Andreas Schaal, Director of the OECD Global Relations and Co-operation Directorate, and Marzena Kisielewska, Head of the OECD South East Europe Division. Umur Gökçe and Ali-Fuad Turgut (OECD South East Europe Division) led this work, which was initially also managed by Martin Kohtze.

Albania is a country with a highly mobile population. Estimates suggest that over 1.2 million Albanian citizens, or more than 44 percent of the current population, have migrated abroad. Albanian migrants are typically of working age and lower-skilled, with the majority living in neighboring Italy and Greece.1 In its recent history, Albania has experienced multiple waves of migration, beginning with economic migration following the collapse of the communist regime, followed by family reunification, and then most recently a diversification of types of emigration. Emigration is driven by large income differentials, with Albania having one of the lowest average wage rates in Europe, and the lowest in the Western Balkans. Albanians are also progressively moving to more and further destinations in Western Europe, particularly Germany.2 In accordance with these geographical shifts, the profile of migrants has also diversified, with a progressively higher share of high-skilled workers. Nevertheless, asylum seeking is still prevalent, with 193,000 Albanians seeking asylum in the EU between 2010-2019, with an acceptance rate of just about 2 percent,3 demonstrating the differing migration pathways.

Figure ES1. Profile of Albanian migrants The Albanian migration story is not just one of emigration, but also of return. Economic liberalization, increases in trade, and financial opening in Albania have created sustained growth that has led to a dynamic economy and more opportunities for migrants to come back. Though there are challenges to gathering accurate data, estimates indicate a total return population of around 250,000 people since the year 2000. This suggests that for every four migrants who left in the last 20 years, approximately one returned.4 The migrants who return are mainly young, and male, with a secondary education, meaning that though men and women migrate in equal numbers, men are more likely to return. The vast majority of returnees are working-age and some return with tertiary education or 1 Gëdeshi and King (2020). 2 European Training Foundation (2007); Gëdeshi and King (2020). 3 Gëdeshi and King (2020). 4 This importantly refers to the formal designation of a migrant as someone who spent at least 12 months abroad, which undercounts the many others who return after less than a year. According to the 2018 Demographic and Health Survey, less than 50 percent of migrants were abroad for more than 12 months in their most recent migration episode.",239,True,False,True,False,0.0

While there are signs in the most recent data that overall, more tertiary-educated migrants are starting to return, the number of returnees is also driven by high levels of recent asylum-seekers, including some who may not have spent a full year abroad in the process and may not be officially counted. These trends are important because migrants may have very different experiences returning based both on their level of education and if they were forced to return or were able to plan for it more consciously.5 Figure ES2.

The Country Profiles analyse trends and policy developments, offering a holistic assessment of the political, economic and social framework of these sectors within a specific country. This initiative was initiated by the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) Committee on Housing and Land Management in the early 1990s, in response to requests from UNECE member States. These studies are requested by member States and carried out by international teams of experts, collaborating with government bodies, other international organizations, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), local authorities and the private sector. Through an extensive consultation process, the experts conduct a comprehensive review of the housing, urban development and land management sectors, formulating recommendations to assist policymakers in devising strategies and programmes.

The Country Profile on Urban Development, Housing and Land Management of Albania was developed in response to a request from the Government of Albania through the Ministry of Finance and Economy. The development of this profile was spearheaded by the Housing and Land Management Unit of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) Division of Forests, Land and Housing, in close collaboration with stakeholders, including experts from the national and local governments. The review process started in December 2022 with a preparatory mission by the UNECE secretariat, during which the final structure of the Country Profile was established. A fact-finding mission, involving a stakeholder consultation workshop led by the international team of experts, was carried out in June 2023. The project received funding from the Regional Programme for Technical Cooperation and, to some extent, from the Office of the United Nations Resident Coordinator in Albania.

The ERP coordination team in the MFE has collaborated closely with government institutions and other public authorities to draft and prepare the Economic Reform Programme 2023-2025, namely the Ministry of Infrastructure and Energy, Ministry of Education and Sport, Ministry of Tourism and Environment, Ministry of Health and Social Protection, Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development, the Bank of Albania, the General Directorate of Taxation, and INSTAT. Other agencies have been involved in the process as subordinated institutions to the aforementioned ones by contributing either with their own reform measures such as the case of NASRI (AKKSHI) for the reform measure #3, or as part of the wider collaboration with their parent institutions for other measures such as the case of NAES (AKPA), etc. The ERP 2023-2025 outlines the main macroeconomic and fiscal policies aiming to establish the clear balance between the internal strengths and external threats, with a view to enable sustainable growth, increased employment and reduced public debt.

In addition, the ERP summaries the priority structural reforms that Albania is implementing for the short-term future with a view to increasing domestic production, stimulating new investments and ensuring sustainable and inclusive growth and competitiveness. Fiscal consolidation continues to be the primary objective of fiscal policy to ensure the macroeconomic stability of the country during all times and most particularly during economic shocks and hardships, which is an essential premise for ensuring a relatively high, sustainable and inclusive economic growth and therefore to the best of the general public interest for the economic convergence toward EU average levels of income per-capita. Fiscal policy will target a gradual downward trajectory of the public debt each year, while the primary balance will return to a positive level from next year 2023 and will continue to do so in the future, in accordance with the fiscal rules in LOB. At the same time, in addition to fiscal consolidation, we will aim to maintain a healthy ratio of current and capital budget expenditures, where capital expenditures of central government (i.e. public investments) will be targeted to be around an annual average of 5.3 percent of GDP over the period 2023-2025, essential to support economic growth in the medium and long term.",243,True,False,True,True,0.0

At the end of the visit, the mission issued the following statement:(imf.org) Key Findings Strong Economic Performance: Albania's economy has shown robust growth in recent years, driven by prudent macroeconomic policies. Output is now well above its pre-pandemic trend, primarily due to a booming tourism sector. (imf.org) Fiscal and Monetary Policies: Prudent fiscal policies have led to a significant reduction in public debt. Proactive monetary policy, declining global commodity prices, and a steady appreciation of the lek have facilitated disinflation. (imf.org) Growth Outlook: Growth prospects are expected to remain robust, with balanced risks to the outlook. (imf.org) Structural Challenges GDP Per Capita: Despite positive macroeconomic indicators, GDP per capita remains around a quarter of the U.S. and EU-15 levels. (imf.org) Demographic Trends: Rapid aging and emigration pose significant challenges to the economy. (imf.org) Governance and Institutions: While there has been progress in rule of law reforms, governance shortfalls and institutional weaknesses continue to hinder the business environment.

(imf.org) Fiscal Sustainability: Implementing ambitious revenue reforms and strengthening debt management are crucial to maintain fiscal health and meet long-term spending needs. (imf.org) Monetary Policy: A data-dependent approach remains key to ensuring price stability, supported by a flexible exchange rate to absorb shocks. (imf.org) Financial Stability: Enhancing supervision and regulation of banks and non-bank financial institutions, along with deepening financial markets, is necessary to maintain financial stability. (imf.org) EU Accession: Removing barriers to firm growth, transitioning to higher value-added production, and continuing governance reforms are vital to maximize the benefits of EU accession. (imf.org) Performance and Outlook Economic Growth: Albania is projected to be one of Europe’s fastest-growing economies in 2024. After a 3.9% expansion in 2023, real GDP growth is expected at 3.6% in 2024, driven by domestic consumption, tourism, and construction. Growth from 2025 to 2029 is anticipated to remain robust at around 3.5%, sustained by domestic demand and tourism. (imf.org) Inflation: End-of-year inflation in 2024 is expected to be around 2%, below the Bank of Albania’s 3% target. However, base effects from a significant month-on-month drop in early 2024 will temporarily push up inflation in the first half of 2025.",239,True,True,True,True,0.0

In line with this commitment, Albania aims to gradually implement the Youth Guarantee scheme, as outlined in the National Employment and Skills Strategy 2023-2030 (NESS). This strategy specifically targets young people Not in Education, Employment, or Training (NEET), and is in line with the objectives of the Western Balkans Youth Guarantee, as part of the Economic and Investment Plan (EIP) Flagship no. 10.

The main objective of the Operational Programme EU for Youth Employment is to provide unemployed and inactive young people, registered at employment offices, with quality employment, training, or education opportunities within a period of four months from the date of registration. The programme will primarily focus on the NEET population aged 15-29, given their high unemployment and inactivity rates. By addressing the challenges faced by youth in accessing suitable jobs and acquiring relevant skills for the labour market, the Youth Guarantee aims to alleviate the lack of future prospects that often leads to an increased need to emigrate. To facilitate the successful implementation of the Youth Guarantee, Albania has adopted the Youth Guarantee Implementation Plan 2023-2024 (YGIP). This plan will guide the initial pilot phase, which was launched on 27 October 2023. The Operational Programme EU for Youth Employment 2024-2027 aims to provide inclusive and responsive labour market integration of a skilled and adaptable young workforce. The areas of support within the programme are outlined as follows: Area of Support 1: Youth Employment This area of support focuses on enhancing the employment and employability of young people, with a particular emphasis on vulnerable groups. It includes the implementation of a reinforced Youth Guarantee (YG) delivery model, building upon the lessons learned from the pilot phase, and improving the capacities of the National Agency for Employment and Skills (NAES), as well as all the other partners at the local and national level in Albania.",244,True,False,True,False,0.0

The outreach phase in the YGIP in Albania envisages, among other activities, also using digital means as an essential component of modern engagement strategies and including young NEETs in the design of communication campaigns. In this context, NAES is set to introduce a dedicated ""Youth Guarantee"" Portal, serving as a comprehensive platform for sharing information about the Youth Guarantee and enabling NEETs to pre-register. Eligible activities include various initiatives, such as outreach activities in cooperation with the National Agency for Youth (NAY) and youth organisations, preparing youth before they register to the Youth Guarantee, building capacities of youth organisations and information campaigns on youth rights in the workplace.

It emphasises the need to update the initial and continuous Vocational Education and Training (VET) programmes offered by public VET providers, to align with industry needs. New post-secondary education programmes will be developed and delivered through VET schools and through apprenticeship and traineeship models. To support the implementation of these updated programmes, grants will be provided to VET schools to improve the capacities of teaching and management staff, develop teaching materials, and improve governance, facilities and resources. Efforts to improve the learning environment in VET schools will be facilitated by investing in renewed school infrastructure and laboratories, including increased interaction between labour market actors and VET schools, skills competitions, and skills needed to take advantage of new opportunities in the green and digital transitions.

This part of the youth population is most at risk of being excluded from the labour market. NEET rate is calculated as a percentage of the total population of the same age group and gender and reached the level of 26.1% in 2021. Within this group, 37.3% are unemployed, 15.4% are discouraged, 17.5% care for family members and around 29.8% are inactive for other reasons. Men NEET tend to have a higher share of unemployment (46.8%), and women NEET tend to have a higher proportion of inactivity due to family responsibilities (31.6%) (INSTAT, LFS 2021).

The country is seeing rising momentum for the circular economy transition - one of the key pillars of the Green Agenda of the Western Balkans - and has recognised its significance in attaining national and regional environmental objectives. The Ministry of Tourism and Environment is leading this transformative journey, notably through its newly established Directorate for Circular Economy. Despite commendable efforts and increased political and public focus on the circular economy, accompanied by the development of corresponding strategic documents, tangible outcomes of the circular transition remain incomplete. Insufficient awareness, scarce infrastructure, and limited financing options compounded by a lack of co-ordinated action collectively impede the effectiveness of current laws, policies, and overall initiatives, hindering the realisation of the full potential of the circular economy in Albania.",241,True,False,True,True,0.0

Insufficient awareness, scarce infrastructure, and limited financing options compounded by a lack of co-ordinated action collectively impede the effectiveness of current laws, policies, and overall initiatives, hindering the realisation of the full potential of the circular economy in Albania. Guided by the OECD’s circular economy methodology, this roadmap aims to assist the Albanian government in establishing a robust policy foundation for a successful circular transition. Drawing from a thorough diagnostic of Albania’s circular economy landscape, the roadmap strategically incorporates current policy initiatives, and promotes strong alignment across the sectors, policy measures, and stakeholders involved in this transformative process. The in-depth analysis identifies a set of priority areas key for developing circular economy policies in Albania. Accompanied by a monitoring framework, the roadmap puts forward concrete policy recommendations for selected priority areas, including economic instruments, circular business models for small and medium-sized enterprises, and targeted solutions for plastics, with a focus on marine litter. Integrating reforms for sustainable economic growth and implementing action plans for the green agenda are vital for fostering the production of sustainable products within the Common Regional Market.

Key conditions and challenges The Albanian economy has shown consid- erable resilience in the face of consecutive shocks during 2019-2022, which included the 2019 earthquake, the pandemic and the ensuing economic turmoil, and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Prudent macroeco- nomic policies supported a strong eco- nomic rebound, with real GDP growth av- eraging 6.9 percent in 2021 and 2022, and GDP exceeding its pre-pandemic level in 2022. A key factor in Albania’s resilience has been the proximity to the EU, which is a source of investment and remittances, and a main market for exports.",247,True,False,True,False,0.0

Tourism has emerged as a key growth driver, help- ing to improve external imbalances and partially contributing to a steady appreci- ation of the lek in recent years. The avail- ability of hydropower, which meets 85 percent of domestic energy demand in a year with average precipitation, has pro- vided some insulation from the energy crisis and contributed to containing the country’s greenhouse gas emissions. Al- bania’s key development challenges are its declining population, partially due to out- migration; the poor quality of the labor force and the low quality of jobs created; the moderate pace of structural reforms, especially in the areas of private sector en- vironment and governance; and rising fis- cal pressures, due to government respons- es to multiple crises, climate risks, contin- gent liabilities, and debt refinancing at a time of high interest rates.

Given strong GDP per capita growth in 2023, poverty is projected to have declined by 1.8 percentage points to 21.7 percent. The annual inflation rate dropped to 3.9 percent in December 2023 from a record high of 8.3 percent in October 2022, as a result of downward pressures from low- er food and energy import prices, do- mestic currency appreciation and mon- etary policy normalization. The banking system remains resilient, despite increas- ing interest rates. The government recorded an improved fiscal position in 2023, on account of both stronger revenue collection and low- er spending. Revenues from profits, per- sonal income taxes and social security contributions increased, reflecting higher statutory minimum wages and private sector wage growth. A five-year Eu- robond of EUR 600 million was issued with a 5.9 percent coupon, higher than the 3.5 percent in 2021, to prefinance spending in 2024 and buy back an existing Eurobond maturing in 2025.

Framework conditions Albania’s performance on framework conditions is weak but shows improvements across indicators and notably on human resources, where the country registered an increased performance of 33.3%-points compared to the 2017 baseline. This result is driven by a noticeable increase in new doctorate graduates of 11.6%-points since 2017, and by a growth of people with tertiary education that almost doubled (+88.5%-points) in the last eight years. However, despite this progress, the country performs at 59.3% of the 2024 EU average for human resources. Albania’s performance for both attractiveness of research systems and digitalisation rose by 26.4%-points and 17.7%- points compared to 2017, respectively. Nevertheless, the country’s performance on the two dimensions remains much lower than the EU average, at 36.1% and 14.2% of the 2024 EU level, respectively. This is driven by a marked upward trend since 2017 in scientific publications among the top 10% most cited (despite a dip between 2023-2024); and by the number of foreign doctorate students as a percentage of all doctorate students which increased by 19.8%-points since 2017.

The data suggest that the country’s research system is catching up and becoming more internationally open. In terms of digitalisation, the level of broadband penetration and individuals with above basic overall digital skills increased since 2017, however, Albania lags far behind the EU average for these two indicators with performance at less than 20% of the EU level in 2024. Investments Albania has progressed in providing data for this dimension. Available data suggests that firms’ non-R&D investments represent 13.8% of the 2024 EU average, and that enterprises providing ICT training in Albania represent 92.5% of the 2024 EU average. The latter performance reflects the growing adoption of e-commerce by firms (OECD, 2024) and the growing need for enhancing ICT skills to support the digitalisation. 3 European Innovation Scoreboard - 2024 Innovation activities Albania’s performance for this block of indicators is mixed. The share of innovators introducing product and process innovations is below the 2024 EU average, standing at 86.2% and 66.3%, respectively, and registering a negative trend since 2017.

Linkages within the national innovation system remain weak as Albania performs at 40.1% of the EU average in 2024 on this dimension. Lacking financial and non-financial incentives for business-academia collaboration is reflected in low public-private co-publications, standing at only 4.9% of the 2024 EU average, and weak performance on intellectual assets, standing at 5.9% of the 2024 EU average for this dimension. The share of innovative SMEs collaborating with others is moderate, at 69.4% of the 2024 EU average, but saw a decline by almost a third (-27.5%- points) since 2017. This is likely due to gaps in collaboration infrastructure and overall low capacity of Albania’s research system (OECD, 2024). Finally, there has been a negative trend even since 2017 in patent applications (-11.5%-points), with a slight uptick for trademark and design applications which remains at a low level compared to the EU (4.2% and 11.6% of the 2024 EU average).

Knowledge- intensive activities witness a modest 2.8%-point increase since 2017 but remaining at a third of the EU level. These findings tend to confirm a need to further restructure the economy towards more innovation-driven activities and employment in medium- to high-tech sectors to boost knowledge-intensive sectors. However, Albania performs at almost double of the EU average on sales of new-to-market and new-to-firm innovations, as well as on the environment-related technologies. The country registers a 187.3% performance on sales of innovations and 171.9% performance on environmental-related technologies, which saw a significant 68.8%-point increase compared to 2017. 4 European Innovation Scoreboard - 2024 Structural differences Performance and structure of the economy The Albanian economy has proven relatively resilient in recent years but its GDP per capita remains a at one-third that of the EU average. The turnover share of SMEs is higher than in the EU (19% vs 12.6%), suggesting a relatively fragmented economy with large enterprises registering 20.2% of the turnover share, standing at less than half of the EU average.

However, it can be noted that in 2018, the ICT sector contributed 2.9% to Albania's GDP, which was followed by an even greater increase in 2019 (Fabbri et al., 2022). Governance and policy framework The Albanian governance system provides a relatively weak framework for innovators, with Corruption Perception Index almost double that of the EU average, complemented by a poor performance in Rule of law. More positively, the level of government procurement of advanced technology products is slightly higher compared to the EU average.

The report monitors the implementation of interventions under two key policy goals, while providing recommendations to mitigate challenges and improve future outcomes, within a comprehensive monitoring and evaluation of this Strategy. Policy Goal 1: Skills Development and Better Labour Market Matching of Supply and Demand The first policy goal focuses on reducing the skills mismatch, improving upskilling opportunities, and ensuring better functioning of the labour market. Key achievements include: Vocational Education and Training (VET) System Improvements: The VET system has undergone several improvements to become more relevant and flexible, with the development of new occupational standards, qualifications, and the introduction of new programmes. The revision of the National Catalogue of Vocational Qualifications National Vocational Qualification Catalogue, infrastructure modernization in VET, consolidation of quality assurance and development practices through self-assessment and accreditation, schools were significant accomplishments. Private Sector Engagement: The strategy strengthened the systemic involvement of private sector stakeholders in VET governance. Two sectoral committees (ICT, Hospitality & Tourism) were established, and collaborations between VET providers and businesses were enhanced through various joint activities.",237,True,False,True,True,0.0

Two sectoral committees (ICT, Hospitality & Tourism) were established, and collaborations between VET providers and businesses were enhanced through various joint activities. Digital Transformation of Employment Services: The expansion of digital services, such as the employment portal (puna.gov.al) and digital learning platforms (MësoVET), increased access to services for jobseekers and learners. The Labour Market Information Observatory was established to enhance skills intelligence and support data-driven decision-making in the labour market. Policy Goal 2: Inclusive Employment Opportunities The second policy goal emphasizes the promotion of decent employment for all through inclusive labour market policies. Major developments include: Support for Vulnerable Groups: The Ministry of Economy introduced targeted measures to increase employment among vulnerable groups such as long-term unemployed, youth not in education or employment (NEET), women, and persons with disabilities (PWD). These groups were supported through individualized employment plans, specialized training, and social services. Youth Guarantee Scheme: The pilot of the Youth Guarantee was launched in three regions (Tirana, Shkodër, Vlorë) to help NEET youth secure employment or training within four months of registering with the program. Initial results indicate positive outcomes for participants through individualized assistance and active labour market policies. Women’s Labour Market Inclusion: To increase women's participation, especially from rural areas, specialized employment services and flexible employment policies were introduced. This included mobile work offices, financial incentives, and pilot employment programs in underserved areas.",242,True,False,False,True,0.0

This included mobile work offices, financial incentives, and pilot employment programs in underserved areas. 4 Lessons Learned From the first year of implementing the National Employment and Skills Strategy 2023-2030 several lessons learned can support its further implementation: Strengthening Public-Private Partnerships: Collaboration between the VET system and the private sector has shown significant progress, especially with the establishment of sectoral committees. However, stronger and more systematic involvement of businesses in practical training and governance is needed. More incentives and structured partnerships are essential for businesses to provide professional practice opportunities and align skills training with real labor market needs. Enhancing Digital Transformation in Employment Services and VET: The digitalization of employment services and the VET system made considerable strides with the introduction of platforms like puna.gov.al and MësoVET. However, challenges persist in scaling these digital services, especially for vulnerable populations and remote regions. A more user-friendly interface, broader outreach efforts, and technical assistance for underserved areas can ensure these platforms serve a larger audience. Improving Inclusivity in Employment Programs: Targeted measures for vulnerable groups, such as women, youth, and persons with disabilities, have seen initial success, but greater customization is needed to address the specific barriers these groups face. Enhanced efforts should focus on outreach, inclusive service delivery models, and tailored support, particularly in rural areas and regions where employment services are less accessible.",245,True,False,True,False,0.0

Enhanced efforts should focus on outreach, inclusive service delivery models, and tailored support, particularly in rural areas and regions where employment services are less accessible. Expanding Lifelong Learning Opportunities: The progress in developing new vocational standards and training programs indicates a growing demand for reskilling and upskilling, particularly in digital and green sectors. Moving forward, it is critical to create sustainable financing mechanisms for both public and private providers, ensuring broader access to lifelong learning opportunities, especially for adults and older workers. Financial Support and Resource Allocation: Despite considerable progress in improving VET infrastructure and expanding program offerings, the report highlights the need for more sustainable financial mechanisms to support ongoing developments. Future resource allocation must prioritize the scaling of successful programs and ensuring long-term investments in infrastructure, equipment, and training quality. 5 Chapter 1.

The Annual Progress Report provides an overview of the main developments of the reforms in the employment and skills development sector during 2023. It follows the structure of NESS along its policy goals of 1) Skills development and better matching of supply with demand in the labour market for increased employment, and 2) Fostering decent job opportunities for women and men through the implementation of inclusive labour market policies. This Annual Progress Report monitors the implementation of planned activities or interventions for 2023 under each policy measure and for each strategic objective (i.e. outcomes), as well as the achievement of specific results and targets.

The report is structured as follows: Following this introductory chapter (Chapter 1), Chapter two presents the intervention logic or theory of change of the NESS 2023-2030, while Chapter three presents in detail the main results as per two policy goals and associated strategic objectives highlighting the progress made as well as the challenges encountered. Chapter four provides an overivew of key developments in the labour market. Chapter five elaborates the main partnerships, the important role of coordination platforms in the sector such as the Integrated Policy Management Group (IPMG), innovations and lessons learned to date. A specific chapter is dedicated to the efforts of the sector to align to the EU framework and support it has received through various EU programmes.

Reports discuss ‘economic reintegration’ with reference to the key activities associated with the process of economic reintegration, such as vocational training; access to internships; access to employment and entrepreneurship opportunities; support while engaged in new livelihood activities; financial support; environment and market assessments; and monitoring and evaluation of economic reintegration.1 Economic reintegration of trafficking survivors can therefore be understood as the process through which they access a range of vo- cational training and employment services, in order to be economically stable, and no longer at risk of human trafficking. The reintegration of survivors of trafficking in Albania derives from the National Action Plan against Trafficking in Human Beings 2021-2023. There are several normative frameworks in the country that outline the support that should be provided to survivors across the areas of em- ployment, health, housing and economic assistance. Despite the presence of these frameworks, the available literature suggests that there are gaps and challenges in Albania’s economic rein- tegration support for trafficking survivors.",219,True,False,True,False,0.0

Despite the presence of these frameworks, the available literature suggests that there are gaps and challenges in Albania’s economic rein- tegration support for trafficking survivors. For example, Ramaj (2021) highlighted the challenges for survivors in accessing employment, and argued that employment services in Albania are time-consuming and demotivating for trafficking survivors.2 The present study sets out to contrib- ute to the knowledge base regarding economic reintegration of trafficking survivors in Albania by providing a new perspective on the subject - one that explores the experiences of both survivors and frontline professionals in accessing or providing, respectively, economic reintegration sup- port and other related services. Aim and objectives The central aim of the present study is to strengthen the understanding of the challenges that survi- vors and frontline professionals (service providers employed in state agencies and non-governmen- tal organisations (NGOs) face in accessing and providing economic reintegration support in Albania. The study objectives were to undertake the following: • Examine and document the perspectives of survivors and frontline professionals (em- ployed in state agencies and NGOs) regarding gaps and challenges in accessing or pro- viding quality and sustainable economic reintegration support (such as vocational train- ing, internships and employment). • Explore these challenges at different levels, namely those of individual, relationship, community and society.",242,True,False,True,False,0.0

Fourteen interviews were conducted with traf- ficking survivors, and 27 interviews and 6 FGDs were held with key informants, including social workers, social service administrators and shelter staff. The criteria for the survivors to participate included: • Being of age 18 years or above; • Being trafficked Albanian nationals, including minority groups (not foreign nationals); • Having been receiving economic reintegration support for at least three months; • Having, at the time of the interview, received support any time during the last two years; • Having been screened by their caseworker as able to answer the interview questions without becoming distressed. Only trafficking survivors who met the above inclusion criteria were invited to participate in the study. Findings Vocational training The study identified that it is important for the vocational training options to match, to the maximum extent possible, the survivors’ level of education with the employment and business opportunities. This is important for ensuring that survivors are able to find decent employment following completion of vocational training. Furthermore, it is important for survivors to have in- formation on all training options available to them, and to choose the ones they wish to pursue, otherwise, if they are not interested, there is a strong chance they will cease their participation.",221,True,False,False,False,0.0

In addition, the study identified that vocational training should include life skills and business man- agement components, and that certification should be provided as it would support a valuable pathway to employment. Of the 14 interviewed survivors, 13 (93%) were female, and 1 (7%) was male. At the time of interview, the survivors were of age 18-36 years. All had received reintegration support from one of the NGO-run shelters for between three months and four years. 14 interviewed survivors age 18-36 years 13 females 1 male 10 Economic reintegration of trafficking survivors in Albania Key informants further emphasised that the pathway from vocational training to employment or starting a business is not necessarily linear, and economic reintegration support should not finish at the employment stage.

Key informants reported that it is important that frontline pro- fessionals follow the advisory cycle, which provides a framework for the survivor to explore a range of vocational training opportunities, while all the time being guided by advice. Survivors face a number of challenges in accessing quality vocational training, including lack of access to free childcare, difficulties accessing vocational training in rural areas of the country and the short duration and low quality of some trainings provided in vocational training centres. Internships and employment support The study identified that internships are a valuable learning opportunity, which should precede employment for survivors who have not previously worked. The study further identified that companies that will employ survivors as interns must be vetted in order to ensure the safety and security of survivors. Key informants highlighted that it is important for internships to be remunerated. For survivors who have not previously worked, remuneration helps them become accustomed to receiving regular paycheques from their employer, and increases their budget management skills and overall confidence to enter the labour market.

The study found that appropriate training and internships can lead to decent employment for survi- vors in Albania. Seven interviewed survivors (50%) were, at the time of interview, employed in the same field in which they had trained: as a tailor, hairdresser, cook, car mechanic or other profession. The study identified some key challenges for survivors in entering and sustaining new employ- ment, including lack of decent job opportunities in Albania, lack of interest in the jobs, lack of ed- ucation, lack of affordable childcare, ongoing trauma and stigma. The study further identified that few survivors are successful in finding employment quickly after registering with the National Agency for Employment and Skills (NAES). Support to start a new business The study found that starting a business may be a very empowering experience for survivors. Through the processes of planning and managing, survivors can experience significant increases in business and financial management nous, and confidence. However, they face challenges in starting and maintaining their own business, including lack of business know-how, insufficient start-up capital, and the presence of business competition and stigma.

The study further identi- fied that some of the challenges associated with starting and maintaining a business are unique to trafficking survivors. For example, they cannot borrow to take on financial loans as easily as other individuals, for fear of debt making them vulnerable to exploitation, and they cannot run a business from home for security reasons. Other services that support economic reintegration The study identified that economic reintegration of trafficking survivors through vocational train- ing, internships, job placement and support to start a business does not occur in isolation of other support services. These were highlighted in the interviews and from the Focus group discussions 11 Economic reintegration of trafficking survivors in Albania (FGD) as education, healthcare, housing and economic assistance. The study further identified that free childcare is an important support service. Education support is critical to economic reintegration. The study found that young survivors who are supported to complete high school have a better chance of finding decent employment than those who have not completed high school, and survivors who complete higher (university) educa- tion have an even greater chance of finding decent professional work.

One barrier is their age: those who are in their twenties or thirties may feel that it is too late for them to (re-)enrol in high school. Another barrier is their financial situation. Survivors who are living in the community have to pay for rent and other essentials, and thus may prioritise employment over education.

The CO provides comprehensive guidance to navigate economic reforms, enhance regional co-operation and help the region’s economies align their legal frameworks and policies with those of the OECD and EU. It also enables policy makers to track performance over time, by comparing outcomes against those reported in the previous editions since 2016. The CO 2024 comprises seven reports: one regional and six economy profiles. Each economy profile evaluates performance across each of the 15 policy dimensions, highlighting areas of progress as well as those requiring continued improvement. The regional profile presents findings for the whole Western Balkans across five policy clusters - infrastructure and connectivity, skills, business environment, digital transformation and greening - and seeks to evaluate the broader regional trends in these areas. Complementing these reports, the publication’s findings are accessible for the first time through a landmark interactive digital tool: the Western Balkans Competitiveness Data Hub.",229,True,False,True,False,0.0

KEY POLICY DEVELOPMENTS IN EDUCATION, TRAINING AND EMPLOYMENT - ALBANIA 2024 | 03 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY In 2023, Albania took significant steps to address longstanding challenges exacerbated by events such as the 2019 earthquake, the 2020 pandemic, and inflation driven by Russia's invasion of Ukraine. These crises severely impacted Albania's economy, labour market, and under-resourced education system. Despite these challenges, Albania achieved notable progress in education, vocational training, and employment policies. The launch of the National Employment and Skills Strategy (2023-2030) underscored Albania's commitment to addressing infrastructure needs, digitalisation, environmental sustainability, and enhancing the quality of vocational education and training (VET). The strategy emphasises lifelong learning, work-based learning, and civic engagement. The public employment services were reinforced, with training and active labour market measures expanded to support vulnerable groups better. Albania's employment landscape has recovered since the COVID-19 pandemic, with declining NEET (not in employment, education, or training) rates and moderate increases in employment and wages. While challenges persist, such as youth unemployment and job quality, the country is on a positive trajectory, bolstered by EU accession negotiations and significant foreign aid investments.",249,True,False,True,False,0.0

While challenges persist, such as youth unemployment and job quality, the country is on a positive trajectory, bolstered by EU accession negotiations and significant foreign aid investments. Demographic shifts, including rapid ageing and high emigration rates, pose significant challenges. Albania's population is ageing, with urbanisation concentrated in Tirana, while most regions face depopulation. The education system is struggling with declining enrolment, particularly in vocational education, and there is a critical need for lifelong learning initiatives to boost adult participation in education and training. Politically, Albania remains steadfast in its commitment to EU integration, with significant reforms in governance, justice, and anti-corruption efforts. The government has also prioritised investments in infrastructure, energy sustainability, and economic development to foster long-term recovery and growth. In conclusion, Albania has made substantial strides in reforming its education, training, and employment sectors. However, continued efforts are needed to address demographic challenges, expand vocational training and adult learning opportunities, and improve the overall quality and inclusiveness of education to ensure sustainable development.

KEY POLITICAL, DEMOGRAPHIC, ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL CHARACTERISTICS Political developments The current Prime Minister, Edi Rama, regarded as ardent pro-European by most observers, secured his third consecutive victory in the parliamentary elections held in April 2021. He leads the government as prime minister in this parliamentary democracy until 2025. Notably, he has skilfully established himself as a key negotiator in the Serbia-Kosovo disputes throughout 2023 and is regularly quoted for his vocal and often constructive criticism of the EU accession process. The Albanian government has been primarily focused on two significant challenges: recovering from the November 2019 earthquake and addressing the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic while maintaining the momentum of ongoing reforms. Albania approved a record-breaking 2024 budget focused on fostering sustainable economic development, increasing investments in infrastructure, and expanding public welfare programmes. Significant allocations were made towards wage increases, educational support, and public infrastructure projects. In 2023, Albania focused on advancing its EU integration by implementing key reforms in governance and justice and strengthening its economic development through investments in infrastructure, tourism, and energy sustainability. Additionally, the government prioritised anti-corruption efforts and improved healthcare systems as part of its broader social and economic recovery strategy (EC 2023; IMF 2024).

The European Commission submitted its screening report on Cluster 1 (Fundamentals) in July 2023, marking an essential step in accession negotiations. Additionally, Albania is aligning its national reforms with the EU's Growth Plan for the Western Balkans, which aims to accelerate socio-economic transformations, strengthen governance, and enhance digital and green transitions (European Commission 2024). An overwhelming 92% of Albanians view EU membership as a positive development, with 85% expressing the belief that their government should intensify efforts to strengthen relations with the EU. This level of support for EU integration consistently ranks among the highest in the region (RCC, 2023). Demographics The demographic landscape of Albania reveals several concerning trends. The number of births in the country only marginally offsets the combined effects of mortality and emigration rates. Consequently, the population is ageing rapidly, and its overall growth rate has hovered around zero for the past two decades. As of 2023 (the last estimates available), Albania's population stands at 2 771 785, reflecting a continued decline of approximately 1% compared to the previous year (INSTAT, 2024).

Approximately two-thirds of the population resides in urban centres, with Tirana hosting one-third of the total population. It is the sole prefecture in the country witnessing population growth (Betti et al., 2018; INSTAT, 2024). Albania contends with a notably high level of emigration, ranking among the top countries worldwide in terms of emigration as a percentage of the current population. Although emigration witnessed a temporary dip during the COVID-19 pandemic, historical data reveals a consistent upward trajectory in emigration across diverse socio-economic strata and educational backgrounds. Notably, the brain drain phenomenon, particularly among well-educated and highly skilled individuals in their twenties, predominantly targets destinations within the European Union and North America (ETF, 2021). Recent KEY POLICY DEVELOPMENTS IN EDUCATION, TRAINING AND EMPLOYMENT - ALBANIA 2024 | 05 surveys indicate that 49% of respondents expressed a desire to leave the country, with only Kosovo surpassing this number amongst the Western Balkans accession countries. One contributing factor to emigration is the perceived inadequacies of the Albanian education system. Many individuals seek opportunities abroad to access higher-quality education for themselves or their children.

Consequently, Albania boasts a notable presence among Western Balkan countries in terms of the number of students studying abroad. Interestingly, there has been a slight increase in returning emigrants, amounting to 5.9% from 2021 to 2022 (INSTAT, 2022). In the academic year 2023-2024, 533,711 pupils and students were enrolled in formal education, with a decrease of 3.7% compared to the academic year 2022-2023. This trend has lasted for many years and represents a 10% decrease since 2019. This decline across all education levels has far-reaching implications for educational institutions and workforce planning within the education sector (INSTAT, 2024). Key economic developments Albania's economy, primarily composed of micro-enterprises with fewer than ten employees, has remained resilient despite several challenges over the past four years, including the 2020 earthquake, the COVID-19 pandemic, and the impact of Russia's war in Ukraine. After a 3.3% decline in GDP in 2020, the economy rebounded with 8.9% growth in 2021, followed by slower growth of 4.9% in 2022.

The services sector, particularly tourism and construction, and increased private consumption due to rising employment and wages have driven this growth (OECD 2024). Inflation remained moderate between 2019 and 2021 but spiked to 6.7% in 2022 due to Russia's war in Ukraine and surging global food and energy prices. By 2023, inflation eased to 4.3%; this downward trend is expected to continue, with Albania likely to achieve its 3% inflation target by early 2025 (IMF, 2024). In 2021, informality was estimated at 37% of the economy, highlighting the size of the grey market. While there have been efforts to combat informality, such as wage increases and employment growth, informality remains a significant obstacle (OECD, 2024). An older study revealed a notably high proportion of informal employment, constituting 56.7% of total employment, with agriculture (63.9%), wholesale and retail trade (12.6%), and construction (7.6%) being the most prevalent sectors in the informal economy (ILO 2020). INSTAT (2023) further documented that, in 2020, informal employment accounted for 34.1% of employment in the non-agricultural sector. The incidence of vulnerable employment has increased in Albania from 48.2% in 2021 to 49% in 2022 but decreased to 46.8% in 2023 (INSTAT, ETF calculations).

Key social issues Although employment trends in Albania are positive, the labour market faces significant challenges. These include a lack of high-quality job opportunities, elevated youth unemployment and inactivity rates, and a substantial number of vulnerable individuals who remain outside the workforce. These difficulties strain citizens' mutual support systems and pressure the social welfare system. 'Making ends meet' measures a household's ability to cope financially.

The Human Development Index (HDI) values for Albania from 2000 to 2021 highlight steady growth, with the HDI value increasing from 0.660 in 2000 to 0.796 in 2021. This reflects continuous improvement in key areas such as life expectancy, education, and income. While showing significant progress, Albania's HDI is still below the European average. It is competitive within the Western Balkans but has room for growth compared to higher-performing European nations (UNDP, 2024). The most recent European Commission report on Albania states that for education: ""Some progress was made, further strengthening the new National Agency for Employment and Skills, and the continued restructuring of the National Agency for Education, Vocational Training and Qualifications.

The opening of Chapter 26 in Albania's EU accession negotiations in 2023, as well as a notable modification to the Law on Pre-University Education, which extends compulsory education, represent significant milestones in strengthening Albania's alignment with EU standards and fostering greater access to quality education for all. Over the past four years, Albania has undertaken institutional reforms and restructured key agencies responsible for educational support and external evaluation. These efforts aim to decentralise governance mechanisms and enhance service delivery. For instance, the Albanian Quality Assurance Agency (ASCAL) emerged from restructuring the Public Accreditation Agency for Higher Education (PAAHE). ASCAL is the sole institution in the higher education sector entrusted with monitoring and evaluating the quality of higher education.

The average monthly gross wage for an employee is 70,539 ALL.21 Compared to 2022, the average monthly gross wage for an employee in Albania increased by 14 %. 31.1 % of contributors of the category of employees receive an average monthly gross wage up to the official minimum wage level. The gender pay gap (GPP) in 2023 was 6.2 percent, which remains similar to 2022 while noting an increase by 1.7 percentage points compared to 2021.22 (This does not account for women involved in informal work).

Unpaid Care Work and Work-Life Balance In recent years, Albania has undertaken a series of measures aimed at addressing unpaid care work and balancing work and family life, including payment of maternity leave; the right to maintain the workplace for obtaining a four-month full or split parental leave until the child reaches the age of 6 and paid care support for persons with disabilities. However, women continue to exhibit a higher rate of inactivity compared to men, 30.4 percent and 18 percent respectively in 2023. Inactive women are more likely than inactive men to be involved in domestic chores. As of 2023, there remains a gender disparity in domestic tasks, with women leading by approximately 25 percentage points.24 Studies indicate that women devote 21.74 percent of their daily time to unpaid tasks like cooking, cleaning, and childcare, while men contribute just 3.47 percent25.

The overarching goal is to foster sustainable economic development, spur employment growth, and ensure the medium and long-term sustainability of public finances. Concurrently, the program aims to safeguard and reinforce the country's macroeconomic stability. Furthermore, the ERP succinctly outlines crucial structural reforms prioritized by the Albanian government for the short and medium term. These reforms are designed to bolster domestic production, stimulate new investments, and foster sustainable, inclusive growth, enhancing overall competitiveness. The underlying objective of this strategic approach is to provide ongoing visibility to reforms in progress, thereby ensuring the sustained momentum of the priority reform agenda. Over the past three years, Albania's economic performance has showcased remarkable resilience in the face of significant challenges. The nation grappled with a series of rapid and severe external shocks, including an earthquake, a global pandemic, and supply disruptions in essential goods arising from the conflict in Ukraine. Despite these formidable challenges, the country's key economic and financial fundamentals, as well as overall macroeconomic stability, have demonstrated notable resilience.

Even in 2023, despite encountering tighter financing conditions and a slowdown in foreign demand, Albania's economy has continued to perform admirably. Projections indicate a sustained positive trend in the medium term, underscoring the nation's capacity to navigate and overcome adverse economic conditions. The ongoing focus of fiscal policy remains steadfastly centered on fiscal consolidation, positioning it as the primary objective. This strategic approach is crucial for upholding the macroeconomic stability of the country, especially in the face of economic shocks and hardships, laying the foundation for achieving a relatively high, sustainable, and inclusive economic growth trajectory. Within this framework, fiscal policy endeavours to chart a course towards a gradual reduction in public debt. Simultaneously, there is a concerted effort to restore the primary balance to a positive level, starting from the year 2024. This commitment aligns with the stipulated fiscal rules in the Organic Budget Law (OBL), emphasizing the adherence to sound fiscal principles for long- term economic resilience and stability. The primary balance is target at an average of around 0.6 percent per year over the upcoming medium-term period (2024-2026). Notably, commencing from the fiscal year 2024 and onward, this target assumes a legally binding status.

As stipulated in the OBL, it is mandated that starting from 2024 and for each subsequent year, the primary balance will be no less than zero, ensuring a balanced or positive stance. We are targeting a surplus of 0.2 percent of GDP for 2024, projected to expand further to 0.8 percent in 2025 and reaching 0.9 percent in 2026. Consequently, this commitment to fiscal prudence is expected to steer the gross public debt on a downward trajectory, aligning with the respective “debt-brake” fiscal rule. Anticipated figures for 2023 indicate a decline in public debt to around 61.5 percent of GDP (or less) from approximately 64.5 percent in 2022. The trend is set to persist, with an expected further reduction to approximately 59.8 percent in 2024. According to the baseline scenario, public debt is expected to decrease to around 58.9 percent by 2026, with a subsequent decline to approximately 52.7 percent by 2031. Simultaneously with our commitment to fiscal consolidation, we aim to uphold a prudent balance between current and capital budget expenditures. Our focus is on directing central government's capital expenditures, representing the bulk of public investments, to consistently exceed 4.5 percent of GDP annually throughout the 2024-2026 budgetary period (with an average of 5.0 percent per year).

The initial budget revision took place in October, facilitated through a normative act due to the time constrain.

This study examined the economic arguments concerning the fiscal effects i.e., investment of public funds in free universal childcare in Albania. The objectives are to: i) reduce gender inequality in employment, labour market activity and earnings; ii) to promote human capital through greater enrolment of children in early childhood learning and development; and iii) to ensure equal access to all children in formal childcare as to foster the life chances and well-being of children. These arguments are highlighted by computing the benefits and costs of such an investment. The study demonstrates that, under relatively cautious assumptions, the benefits significantly exceed the costs. Thus, publicly funded universal child care would represent a prudent and productive use of scarce public funds in Albania. In order to make such a case, two conditions must be met. First, benefits must exceed costs. The study looks at a comprehensive unpaid work of women and men versus public investment, providing to identify benefits. The study estimated the employment-generating and fiscal effects of investing in universal childcare in Albania. It calculates the total annual costs of investing in childcare that would increase the enrolment (coverage) rate of the children in formal childcare to different target levels.",236,True,False,False,True,0.0

It calculates the total annual costs of investing in childcare that would increase the enrolment (coverage) rate of the children in formal childcare to different target levels. There are several approaches for this analysis including current enrolment rate to target enrolment, however, the study used parameters relevant to the Albanian context. It concludes that for every dollar spent on such a program, approximately two dollars or more worth of benefits are generated for children and their parents (due to employment). The benefits to parents are somewhat identical. Child care frees up parents’ time to participate in the labour force, and this generates two relatively clear benefits. First, employed parents receive wages for that participation. Second, by continuing to be employed while children are young, parents are able to avoid extended absences from the workforce. These absences erode work skills in a variety of ways, and result in future reductions in earning power. Drawing on specific studies of these issues, a value can be assigned to the increases in employment permitted by a comprehensive child care. The benefits of child care are divided into the benefits to children, business society, and the benefits of employment to their parents. The analysis has focused on employment effects, as both types of benefits are critical to this analysis.",229,False,False,False,True,0.0

Therefore, the study analyzed in number of scenarios for benefits and costs analysis for policy option for public investment such as: 8 DEVELOPING A CASE FOR INVESTING IN FREE UNIVERSAL CHILDCARE IN ALBANIA a) Scenario 1: If children enrollment is increased (following ILO, 2018 parameters) b) Scenario 2: If children enrollment is increased with quality improvement c) Scenario 3: Universal enrolment with high-quality child-care services In other words, the investment basis are as follows: a) Increasing access b) Increasing quality c) Supporting inclusion Based on this, public funding can be justified only if a significant portion of the benefits are public including private as the government may raise tax as revenue. The study argues, however, that there is a significant public interest in universal childcare. For families in which parents are employed and those in which they are not, stimulating child care can have strong and long-lasting effects on parent’s employment and child development. And, for some families, good child care can permit parents to maintain job skills and continuous employment experience, with enduring effects on family incomes.",217,True,False,True,False,0.0

And, for some families, good child care can permit parents to maintain job skills and continuous employment experience, with enduring effects on family incomes. In summary, when all this is brought together, the incremental benefits of the identified changes to universal child care arrangements in Albania amount to approximately two dollars plus for every dollar of cost (in monetary terms) to the Government. Therefore, universal child care matters to children, to parents and to society. The benefits of such a program are likely to significantly outweigh the costs, and thus, publicly funded child care deserves a high priority when decisions on the allocation of scarce public funds are made.

Parents are left struggling to manage child care, millions of women are kept out of the workforce, and half of the world’s children go without pre-primary education1. Universal, affordable, high- quality child care is necessary to support parents, especially women and when it is not available, the situation is challenging, such as:  A lack of affordable childcare is frequently cited as one of the biggest barriers to women’s opportunities to work, limiting the type and amount of work in which they can engage in outside the home2.  A lack of childcare can limit productivity and the type of employment women can engage in, preventing women from taking more stable and lucrative opportunities3.  A number of studies and surveys have concluded that childcare allows for longer working hours, higher productivity and income, and employment in the formal, rather than informal, sector.  There is a strong correlation between mothers’ labor force participation and enrollment of children in childcare services4.  Evidence from a range of disciplines confirms that a child’s earliest years are a critical time to invest in building foundational skills.  The benefits of quality childcare and early learning settings include improved school readiness, reduced repetition and drop-out rates, and higher achievement in school5.",244,True,False,False,False,0.0

Albania has seen improvements in subsequent years, however, unemployment and poverty still threaten many Albanian households and continue to have a negative impact on the social status of women in the country. Data on poverty in Albania point to the feminisation of the phenomenon, and an increase in the number of poor children. In Albania, gender inequality represents a serious impediment to acceleration of poverty reduction. Addressing gender inequality plays a primary role in enhancing the well-being of thousands of Albanian children who live in poverty. 1. United Nations Children’s Fund. (2019).

Albanian women spend 21.74 per cent of their day doing unpaid work, including cooking, cleaning and caring for children and family members. This has significant financial and economic impacts for women and society at large.

The country’s economic productivity, a factor determining competitiveness and level of welfare of citizens, is still relatively low compared to the EU: data from the World Development Indicators database (2022) show that the average productivity rate (measured in constant international dollars for Purchasing Power Parity as a contribution to the GDP of each employed person) equalled 31.2 percent of the EU average in 2012 and 34.7 percent in 2021. The activities with a high added value and accounting for one-third of employment (excluding agriculture and public administration) had the largest increase in employment in the last decade (Figure 2). Besides the increase in productivity nationally, it is worth considering the significant productivity differences among the various sectors of the economy. During 2011-2020, the non- agricultural sectors with the largest increase in productivity were health care (2.4% of employment), miscellaneous services (9%), publishing and software (0.5%), professional services (7.3%), and energy and gas (6.2%).

The International Protocol is reviewed during each survey cycle in preparation for the next phase of data collection. Following the review, the existing items may be retained, modified, or replaced. New topics may also be introduced.

At the same time, the questionnaire is the same as the one used from the beginning of the study for our country until today. This fact makes it possible to compare data and draw conclusions about the behaviours of school-aged children between different countries applying this project, as well as to compare these data across different time periods within the same country, pointing to behavioural changes, as well as developmental trends for different behaviours in adolescents. Such data make it possible to anticipate adolescent behavioural developments with sound government policies in their respective countries, favouring the success of these policies and achieving national-level objectives.

METHODOLOGY HBSC is a school-based study, based on self-administration of questionnaires by children in classes. The international standard questionnaire developed and updated every four years enables the collection of common data across all participating countries and thus enables the quantification of patterns of key health behaviours, health indicators, and contextual variables. These data allow comparisons to be made between countries, enabling subsequent studies to analyse trends. Study design During May 2022, a cross-sectional study was conducted in all 12 prefectures of Albania among children aged 11, 13, and 15 years. Three age groups of children were sampled according to time periods that represent the onset of adolescence - age 11; the challenge of physical and emotional change - age 13; the years when very important life and career decisions are beginning to be made - age 15. Target population The specific population selected for the sample included children of school age (11, 13, and 15 years old), that is, those in their 12th, 14th and 16th. According to the study protocol, it was strongly recommended that the first priority should be to produce a basic country sample. Sample size Based on the HBSC international protocol, the minimum sample size needed for each age group was 1550, amounting to a total of 4650 students.

During fieldwork, the total number of students recruited was 5545, but the number of those involved in the study was 5454. The EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 11 SURVEY IN ALBANIA Health Behaviour in School-aged Children - 11,13, and 15 years old technique used for sampling was “cluster sampling”, the cluster being the school class. The school classes were randomly sampled. The recommended minimum sample size for each of the three age groups was 1550 children. This calculation assumes a confidence interval (CI) of +/-3% @ 95% and a design effect of 1.2 based on analyses of the 1993-94 and 1997-1998 survey. Drawing the Sample In terms of the sampling procedure, age was the first priority, assuring that each of the three age group samples was drawn from all those in the appropriate age group.The sampling technique consisted of a stratified multistage cluster sampling with probability proportional to size (PPS). The stratification was based on the prefectures of Albania, both in rural and urban areas. Of note, the size of the population is more or less equal in the urban and rural areas of the country.",235,True,True,True,False,0.0

For all stages, the respective sample selected was extracted from the database of the Ministry of Education and Sport. The study was conducted at the end of the 2021-2022 academic year, and children of a specific age group were likely to be found across two different grade levels. For instance, children belonging to the age group of 11 year olds were in the 5th and 6th grade.

The use of a standard COSI & COVID-19 data collection protocol to assess childhood obesity and children’s daily routines and behaviours enables the comparison of the outcome data compiled by our country with the data from other countries participating in the same WHO initiative. This report presents the main results of the third round of COSI for Albania (and WHO_ COSI sixth round of data collection), which took place between 2021 and 2023. For the first time this report also includes data on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the daily routine and behaviours of primary school-age children in Albania, following the COSI approach. The analysis of study data according to the WHO BMI limit values shows that, overall, 30.2% of children aged 8-9 years are overweight, of which 14.2% are obese. The prevalence was higher among boys (33.1%) than girls (27.4%), among urban (32.9%) than rural children (25.8%) and children whose parents had a medium and high education level (35.3% and 33.8%, respectively) compared to children with a low parental education level (27.8%).",237,True,True,True,False,0.0

The prevalence of obesity increases as gestational age increases, and it is higher among never breastfed children (20.4%) compared to <6 months breastfed children (15.1%), with the lowest being among >6 months breastfed children (13.8%). The prevalence of overweight (30.2%) among Albanian children aged 8-9 years based on WHO limit values is very close to the average of European children aged 7-9 years (29%) based on the latest data from the WHO-Report COSI round 5_ 2018-2020 (19). However, for the age group of 8-9 years (which corresponds to our study population) in this round of data collection, the European average of overweight and obesity is higher. Large differences are noticed across countries, with overweight prevalence ranging from 21.1% to 41.7%, and obesity from 7.1% to 19.2%. The prevalence of overweight and obesity based on the latest data from the WHO-Report COSI round 5_ 2018-2020 is clearly higher in children aged 8-9 years than in any other age group; it is higher in urban than in rural areas and higher in males than in females.",244,True,True,True,False,0.0

The prevalence of obesity in Albanian children aged 8-9 years by gender (17.7% in males and 10.7% in females) is in the midrange of the indicator in European countries for the same age group (from 9.6% to 25.4 in males and from 4.6% to 17.2% in females). In the 16 countries where data were collected for more than one age group, there was a tendency for the prevalence of overweight to increase with age among boys and girls and the prevalence of obesity to increase with age for boys. However, it is worth noting that the latest data from the WHO-Report COSI round do not pertain to the period of lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

School closures disrupted learning and changed the lifestyles of children. Different studies from a number of countries in the European Region indicate that the prevalence of overweight and obesity and/or mean body mass index in children and adolescents increased during the COVID-19 pandemic. In one study conducted in the USA, which compared the obesity prevalence between the pre-pandemic and pandemic period, the overall obesity prevalence increased from 13.7% to 15.4% in 2020. (56) In particular, children with overweight and obesity appeared to be at risk for accelerated weight gain during the COVID-19 pandemic. COV-EAT, a study on children and adolescent lifestyles during lockdown in Greece indicated that 35% of parents reported an increase in body weight among their children.",198,True,True,True,False,0.0

COV-EAT, a study on children and adolescent lifestyles during lockdown in Greece indicated that 35% of parents reported an increase in body weight among their children. These results correspond to our findings as the proportion of parents thinking that their child is extremely overweight during the pandemic increases significantly with the increase in perceived weight prior to the pandemic (0%, 0.2%, 10.2%, and 53.8% among parents thinking their child is underweight, normal weight, overweight, or extremely overweight before the pandemic, respectively). This relation has a highly significant linear trend. These studies suggest that pre-existing paediatric obesity was aggravated during the COVID-19 pandemic era. Given the importance of diet and physical activity as determinants of overweight and obesity, COSI collects data on the frequency of consumption of breakfast, fresh fruit and vegetables - all considered to be important elements of a healthy diet - as well as frequency of soft drinks consumption. On the measurement day, two out of five children (42.3%) stated that they had not had breakfast. A significant correlation is observed: the prevalence of breakfast skipping monotonically increasing with the increase in BMI - from 35% of thin children skipping breakfast, to 40.5%, 44.1% and 50.3% of normal, overweight and obese children skipping breakfast, respectively. The prevalence of breakfast consumption on that day was highest among children in rural (60.3%) than urban (56.1%) areas.",247,True,True,False,False,0.0

The prevalence of breakfast consumption on that day was highest among children in rural (60.3%) than urban (56.1%) areas. The data also show that the proportion of children having breakfast increases significantly with the increase in parental education level. About four out of five parents (79%) report that their children have breakfast at home every day (70.4%) or almost every day (8.5%). The rates of daily breakfast consumption in European countries ranged from 94% in Portugal and Denmark to only 44% in Armenia and 49% in Greece. Significantly higher percentages of urban children (72.1%) compared to rural children (67.7%) consumed breakfast daily and the prevalence of daily breakfast consumption increases with the increase in parental education level. The proportion of children never having breakfast was 5.1%. Overall, two thirds of children (67.1%) consume fresh fruit daily. Our results are higher compared to other European countries where the highest daily fruit consumers were found in Portugal (63%), Ireland (61%), and Denmark (60%).

Conversely, less than one thirds of children (29.9%) consume vegetables daily. The prevalence of rare (never or less than once a week) vegetable consumption is significantly higher among boys, rural area children and it is negatively associated with parental education level. The percentage of European children eating vegetables every day varied widely between countries, ranging from 57% in Portugal and Denmark to only 13% of children in Georgia and Spain.

The frequent consumption of soft drinks containing sugar was higher among rural children (11%) than urban children (7.4%) and it was higher in the children of parents with a low level of education than in the children of parents with a high level of education, similarly to the European trend.

European children have become less active as environments and opportunities for safe active play, recreation, and transport have decreased. COSI round 6 collected data on travel to and from school and on time spent practicing sports/dancing, playing actively/ vigorously, watching television, and using electronic devices. About six in ten children (59.1%) travelled to and from school actively (on foot, by bicycle, skating or by non- motorized scooter) compared to only 41% of 6-9-year-old children in European countries. The proportion of children using motorized vehicles to and from school increases with the increase in parental education level, similarly to the trend found in the majority of European countries that participated in COSI ROUND 5th. The prevalence of overweight and obesity is significantly higher among children using less healthy means of transportation to and from school compared to children using healthy transportation means.

Document introduction and purpose Primary Health Care is considered a fundamental service in the Albanian Health System efforts to control diseases and protect all population health. The Albanian Primary Health Care (PHC) has been established for the first time but is based on a well-established tradition. It states that the majority of the population’s contacts with the health system occur at the Health Center level and many health problems are addressed by general practitioners or even nurses in primary health care facilities. However, demographic and epidemiological changes, ever-increasing expectations for health care, linked with the high risks of increasing inequalities, require more support, adaptation, and reform in primary health care. This strategy will determine the way of preparing the primary health care system that will better and efficiently address the health needs of all communities and categories of populations. Better access of vulnerable communities to health care services will be achieved through better horizontal integration of the various specialized professionals working at the community level, as well as vertical integration (continuity of care between PHC and hospital/ other specialty areas).",209,True,False,False,False,0.0

Better access of vulnerable communities to health care services will be achieved through better horizontal integration of the various specialized professionals working at the community level, as well as vertical integration (continuity of care between PHC and hospital/ other specialty areas). New service models will be set up to meet the most pressing needs identified at the community level, such as non- communicable disease prevention and control (NCDs), home care for the elderly, models of care through digital technology, especially in remote areas, etc. The PHC strategy aims at improving the reputation, self-esteem, and motivation of Primary Health Care workers. Lastly, the strategy will serve to achieve the political vision of a National Health Care System oriented towards universal coverage. 10 The strategy takes into account the PHC institutions and services financing rules based on Decision of Council of Ministers no. 737, dated 5.11.2014, “On the financing of PHC services from the compulsory health insurance scheme”. Also, this strategy determines the Health Services Package need for adaptation, in the public PHC funded by the Compulsory Health Insurance Fund approved by Decision no. 101 dated 4.2.2015.

The PHC development strategy is also established pursuant to other documents of the Government of Albania, particularly the National Health Strategy 2016-2020, NCDs Control Plan of 2016-2020, the Health Promotion Action Plan 2017-2021, etc. The strategy for the development of PHC services of 2020-2025 is drafted pursuant to the National Strategy for Development and Integration, 2015- 2020 (Component: ‘Social Capital Investment, and the ‘A stronger and more accessible Health Care System’ goal) in accordance with the vision “Albania - a strengthening democracy, towards its EU integration with a competitive, stable and sustainable economy, that guarantees fundamental human rights and freedoms”. This strategy is also in line with international standards and documents based on the principles of universal health care coverage under the World Health Organization European Framework for Action on Integrated Health Services Delivery’ 2016.

PHC system governance, organization and capacities challenges Health Care governance and organization in Albania aims to guarantee the public accountability of the institutions, while at the same time encouraging the motivation of health care professionals and greater efficiency in service delivery. The country is being subjected to significant structural reforms: the merging of health and social policy-making institutions at the national level, an institutional reform that has led to the creation of new institutions, such as the National Health Care Operator with its 4 regional directorates which are undertaking a series of functions in health care planning and administration in the primary and secondary health care services field. These developments have followed a broad territorial reform integrating small communities into larger municipalities as well as performing a decentralization process that aims to enhance power and accountability at the local government level. Over the last decade, there have been an increased number of visits at the PHC services, driven by growing health needs, better access to services and changes in health behavior. However, although in 2017 there were 7,942,742 visits performed at PHC institutions with an average of 2.7 visits per capita per year, still the indicator remains low compared to other European countries. There are 1,538 general practitioners working in the 413 health centers in Albania, (the number of specialist physicians is 287) and 6,864 nurses and laboratory technicians.

Moreover, by implementing the Strategy on the development of PHC services in Albania 2020 -2025 (1) of the Albanian Ministry of Health and Social Protection (MoHSP) aims to foster more proactive e community services to address population health needs, with a particular focus on the socioeconomic determinants of health. To achieve this, PHC teams have been expanded to include social workers and psychologists working in the newly designed Primary Social Health-Care Centres. Improved PHC in rural municipalities is also planned through a network based PHC service delivery model and multi-professional team working. However, a number of factors are constraining progress with the strategy including a shortage of family medicine (FM) doctors, trained in accordance with international best PHC practices and with the competencies to lead expanded PHC teams.

The Family Medicine Centre Model document (3) sets out in detail the vision for future functions, roles and equipment. Implementing the model will require a sustained change management programme, for despite impressive progress since the last WHO mission, we observed several factors which are limiting these centres from reaching their full potential. First, PHC doctors’ scope of practice is severely limited by lack of access to diagnostic tests, other than simple tests carried out in some 24/7 urgent clinics.

This is because health insurance fund (HIF) cost containment policies and regulations require that specialist order most diagnostic tests advised by FD. However, that results in higher costs due to unnecessary referrals to specialists and lower trust in FD by patients. We noted that the well-developed health check system includes daily sample collection from all PHC centres with check-up facilities with transport to high-quality laboratories, providing feedback through e-check-up records. However, this well-organized sample collection system is not available for other reasons such as patients with NCDs, needing tests to monitor their condition. Second, many of the doctors and other PHC team members we talked to described feeling overwhelmed by demand for appointments, many for administrative issues, for example, requesting a vaccination certificate that could be addressed by nurses. There are two or three nurses per family doctor (sometimes more ), and we spoke to many FM doctors in both urban and rural PHC centres who saw their potential to do more tasks and work more autonomously.

Access to blood tests could linked to transport and laboratory collection systems used by 24/7 urgent care clinics and health-check systems. This will extend the scope of clinical care that can be delivered the PHC setting. We also recommend introducing triage systems to assess and prioritise alongside advanced appointment booking to ensure that appointments requests are prioritised according to urgency of needs and allocated to a clinician, who may not be a doctor, with the knowledge and skills to meet their need. Triage systems also identify requests which don’t require a doctor (for example, requesting certificates or medical reports) and divert these requests to nurses or others, freeing up doctors to deal with complex problems.

Developing scope of practice and competences of PHC professionals - key findings It is very positive that the new PHC centres have multidisciplinary PHC teams which include physiotherapists, logopaedists, psychologists and social workers. However, we identified various challenges which must be addressed. We heard many critical accounts of the status of FM from many informants. There are growing prestige of narrow specialties, that have higher recognition from medical and civil societies. PHC doctors that obtained through residency family medicine specialization are still not recognized as specialists. Lack of respect and recognition of the value of FM as important specialization is discouraging doctors from training in FM. Moreover that are system disincentives by low pay for FM-trained doctors because they are not ‘specialists’ and by established rules preventing some diagnostic testing and prescription of some medicines limit their scope of practice and resolutive capacity (see above 5.1.1). This drives a shortage of FM doctors in some areas and difficulty recruiting to vacant posts. Consequently, only 10% of all PHC physicians are FM trained. There is also a large PHC nursing workforce with three to four nurses for every GP or FM doctor. However, apart from the private non for profit ABC clinic, we observed significant UNDERUSE of the skills of nurses, who have at least three years training.",245,True,True,False,False,0.0

We did not see PHC nurses leading NCD management or assessing and managing minor illnesses, as happens in many other countries, often supported structured templates which ensure the reviews are evidence based. . Recommendations for developing the PHC workforce and multidisciplinary working We recommend immediate policy action to increase the status of FM in order to attract doctors into training posts and create a ‘pipeline’ for the future workforce. Without this, FM doctor shortages are likely to increase. Building on comments from many informants, we recommend increasing the salary of FM doctors to the same rate as specialists (this could be phased over a 2-3 year period) with options for current GPs working in PHC to undertake a ‘bridging’ training to FM status to qualify for the higher pay rate. The FM training (and the bridging option) could draw on the curriculum from other European Region countries with a strong focus on preventive health care, ‘medical generalist competences’ and continuity of care.",207,True,False,False,False,0.0

The FM training (and the bridging option) could draw on the curriculum from other European Region countries with a strong focus on preventive health care, ‘medical generalist competences’ and continuity of care. This helps to build a long term relationship between doctors and patients, allowing holistic assessment of problems in the context of personal, family and social context and creating pre-conditions to introduce evidence based tools for effective interventions, such as brief interventions to address life style and other risk factors for NCDs. We also recommend increasing the professional autonomy of FMs by reviewing the legal, regulatory and health insurance limitations on their professional practice and (see above) enabling them to access a range of diagnostics and extending prescribing rights in accordance with good practice guidelines and protocols. While we observed good working relationships between the different clinicians in PHC centres, we recommend that multi-disciplinary team (MDT) work is extended through the training and upskilling of nurses and MDT members and regular MDT meetings.

The three action plans that we recommend below need to be led by doctors working with other stakeholders, which requires FM doctors with leadership skills, We recommend that you identify a group of FM doctors with an interest in changing and improving services, this could be done through running a focus group for interested doctors about redesigning the PHC model, selecting from among participants, and supporting them to take study modules from existing Master’s courses (either within Albania or international courses). They will need to learn non-clinical skills in PHC performance management and in leadership and change management, interprofessional communication and managing conflict. These skills will help them to lead the initiatives we describe below. In relation to nursing, we recommend identifying nurses with an interest in learning about NCD reviews and how to monitor single conditions such as asthma and hypertension.

The ECG ensures that every child in Europe at risk of poverty or social exclusion has access to the most basic human rights: free early childhood education and care free education (including school-based activities and at least one healthy meal each school day) free healthcare healthy nutrition, and adequate housing.

In 2022-2023, during an initial bilateral screening in Brussels, the EU Commission presented the ECG to the Albanian Government representative. The prospect was received with enthusiasm and the Ministry of Health and Social Protection (MOHSP) followed up with UNICEF Albania in Tirana to learn more. The ECG would not only offer financial investment, but would further demonstrate Albania’s commitment to EU standards, particularly as pertains to maternal and child health (MCH), as the country positions for accession. The ECG represents an opportunity for Albania to develop an integrated set of measures and policies aimed at reaching families to prevent and eliminate numerous sources of inequality among children. However, ECG program activities must build upon existing MOHSP services and not be packaged as a new intervention. Combining a long established but basic infrastructure with the potential for much needed scale-up, Albania’s home visitation program (HVP) offers the ideal foundation for ECG investment.

While many health risks are influenced by climate, it is expected that projected climate change will also affect health. Rising air and water temperatures and more intense extreme events are expected to affect human biological capacity for adaptation. They will affect, as well, food and water safety, increasing exposure to vector, food, and waterborne infectious diseases. Transmissible or not transmissible heat related diseases and deaths may also increase. Changes in temperature and precipitation increase the risk of air pollution. Additionally, exposure to heat waves, floods, landslides, droughts, wildfires, and other extreme events related to climate change may affect general well-being and create stresses for mental health. Climate doesn’t threaten health only by direct exposure. It also depends largely on a complex set of vulnerability factors. The IPCC defines vulnerability as predisposition to be affected by climate-related health conditions. It includes three elements: 1) exposure to external stressors (physical, biological, psychosocial etc), 2) sensitivity to be affected by climate variability, and 3) capacity of people, communities or systems to adjust or respond to consequences, their resilience to get prepared and recover from adverse events.",221,True,False,False,False,0.0

In this context, children are particularly vulnerable to extreme weather events, as they have a reduced capacity to regulate their body temperature and also, are not able to protect themselves. RATIONALE FOR THE ASSESSMENT The health and well-being of children will continue to be affected in many ways by a changing climate. Children are uniquely vulnerable to climate change in part because of the natural physiology of developing and growing bodies, with short term and lifelong consequences. Additionally, children’ exposure to risks during a longer period of life adds to their vulnerability compared to adults; the children born today will suffer all their life from the cumulative impact of climate change.

These risks are increased in children who suffer from a chronic illness or who live in unsanitary or contaminated environments. Older babies and toddlers can thermoregulate better, but they are often unable to communicate their temperature discomfort. They rely on caregivers to help them adjust clothing and change their environment (Auger et al). The WHO has presented substantial evidence about the disproportionate vulnerability of children in response to climate change. The diseases likely to be potentiated by climate change are already the primary causes of child morbidity and mortality, including vector-borne diseases, water-borne diseases and air-borne diseases. Research shows that the annual death rate of children under five years old could double in low- income countries by 2050 compared with the decade 2005-2015, in a scenario without effective mitigation of rising carbon emissions (Chapman et al). The increase may undermine gains made in other areas of child health and slow the global development progress towards the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals, which seek to end preventable deaths of children under- five and reduce under-five mortality. Natural disasters and extreme weather events can cause injuries and deaths. Their indirect effects include people being displaced from their homes, living in overcrowded shelters, socio- emotional effects or longer-term mental health effects attributable to stress, loss of loved ones, possessions, family livelihood and daily habits.

Shortages or contamination of food and water can also compromise health. The suspension of care or school can influence the course or quality of life, as well as physical and mental health (Buka et al). Increasing rates of air pollution include particulate matter from wildfires, smoke and airborne dust linked to climate change, as well as ground ozone, pollens and spores. As air quality deteriorates, rates of respiratory and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality increase, including asthma exacerbations (Guarnieri et al). Air pollution is an environmental cancer risk that the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) classified as a “group 1 carcinogen” in 2013. Children's faster respiratory rate, pulmonary immaturity, and the time they spend outdoors make them more vulnerable to poor air quality than adults. Exposure to air pollution during the prenatal period and early childhood can be particularly dangerous.

The distribution of disease-carrying vectors is expected to be altered by climate change, whereas the transmission and survival of infectious pathogens will be influenced by changing weather patterns. Infectious diseases take a disproportionately high toll on children in general, and socioeconomically vulnerable children in particular. A systematic review of the association between temperature and all causes of diarrhea suggested that climate change could be responsible for a substantial portion of diarrhea cases. Specifically, the prevalence of Escherichia coli, Cryptosporidium, rotaviruses, and parasites increases with higher temperatures. Rural areas suffer from higher diarrhea incidence rate among children due to the use of unsafe drinking sources and limited hygiene. Temperature seems to be the most important weather variable associated with diarrhea. On the other hand, climate variability in the form of increased rainfall and humidity correlates with a higher risk of contracting bacterial and viral lower respiratory tract infections among children.

This study examined the economic arguments concerning the fiscal effects i.e., investment of public funds in free universal childcare in Albania. The objectives are to: i) reduce gender inequality in employment, labour market activity and earnings; ii) to promote human capital through greater enrolment of children in early childhood learning and development; and iii) to ensure equal access to all children in formal childcare as to foster the life chances and well-being of children. These arguments are highlighted by computing the benefits and costs of such an investment. The study demonstrates that, under relatively cautious assumptions, the benefits significantly exceed the costs. Thus, publicly funded universal child care would represent a prudent and productive use of scarce public funds in Albania. In order to make such a case, two conditions must be met. First, benefits must exceed costs. The study looks at a comprehensive unpaid work of women and men versus public investment, providing to identify benefits. The study estimated the employment-generating and fiscal effects of investing in universal childcare in Albania. It calculates the total annual costs of investing in childcare that would increase the enrolment (coverage) rate of the children in formal childcare to different target levels.",236,True,False,False,True,0.0

It calculates the total annual costs of investing in childcare that would increase the enrolment (coverage) rate of the children in formal childcare to different target levels. There are several approaches for this analysis including current enrolment rate to target enrolment, however, the study used parameters relevant to the Albanian context. It concludes that for every dollar spent on such a program, approximately two dollars or more worth of benefits are generated for children and their parents (due to employment). The benefits to parents are somewhat identical. Child care frees up parents’ time to participate in the labour force, and this generates two relatively clear benefits. First, employed parents receive wages for that participation. Second, by continuing to be employed while children are young, parents are able to avoid extended absences from the workforce. These absences erode work skills in a variety of ways, and result in future reductions in earning power. Drawing on specific studies of these issues, a value can be assigned to the increases in employment permitted by a comprehensive child care. The benefits of child care are divided into the benefits to children, business society, and the benefits of employment to their parents. The analysis has focused on employment effects, as both types of benefits are critical to this analysis.",229,False,False,False,True,0.0

Therefore, the study analyzed in number of scenarios for benefits and costs analysis for policy option for public investment such as: 8 DEVELOPING A CASE FOR INVESTING IN FREE UNIVERSAL CHILDCARE IN ALBANIA a) Scenario 1: If children enrollment is increased (following ILO, 2018 parameters) b) Scenario 2: If children enrollment is increased with quality improvement c) Scenario 3: Universal enrolment with high-quality child-care services In other words, the investment basis are as follows: a) Increasing access b) Increasing quality c) Supporting inclusion Based on this, public funding can be justified only if a significant portion of the benefits are public including private as the government may raise tax as revenue. The study argues, however, that there is a significant public interest in universal childcare. For families in which parents are employed and those in which they are not, stimulating child care can have strong and long-lasting effects on parent’s employment and child development. And, for some families, good child care can permit parents to maintain job skills and continuous employment experience, with enduring effects on family incomes.",217,True,False,True,False,0.0

And, for some families, good child care can permit parents to maintain job skills and continuous employment experience, with enduring effects on family incomes. In summary, when all this is brought together, the incremental benefits of the identified changes to universal child care arrangements in Albania amount to approximately two dollars plus for every dollar of cost (in monetary terms) to the Government. Therefore, universal child care matters to children, to parents and to society. The benefits of such a program are likely to significantly outweigh the costs, and thus, publicly funded child care deserves a high priority when decisions on the allocation of scarce public funds are made.

Universal, affordable, high- quality child care is necessary to support parents, especially women and when it is not available, the situation is challenging, such as:  A lack of affordable childcare is frequently cited as one of the biggest barriers to women’s opportunities to work, limiting the type and amount of work in which they can engage in outside the home2.  A lack of childcare can limit productivity and the type of employment women can engage in, preventing women from taking more stable and lucrative opportunities3.  A number of studies and surveys have concluded that childcare allows for longer working hours, higher productivity and income, and employment in the formal, rather than informal, sector.  There is a strong correlation between mothers’ labor force participation and enrollment of children in childcare services4.  Evidence from a range of disciplines confirms that a child’s earliest years are a critical time to invest in building foundational skills.  The benefits of quality childcare and early learning settings include improved school readiness, reduced repetition and drop-out rates, and higher achievement in school5.",244,True,False,False,False,0.0

Albania has seen improvements in subsequent years, however, unemployment and poverty still threaten many Albanian households and continue to have a negative impact on the social status of women in the country. Data on poverty in Albania point to the feminisation of the phenomenon, and an increase in the number of poor children. In Albania, gender inequality represents a serious impediment to acceleration of poverty reduction. Addressing gender inequality plays a primary role in enhancing the well-being of thousands of Albanian children who live in poverty. 1. United Nations Children’s Fund. (2019).

Hyrje Ushqyerja është një nga faktorët kryesorë që ndikon në shëndetin e një individi, sidomos gjatë fëmijërisë, për garantimin e shëndetit dhe cilësisë së jetës. Studimet tregojnë se në Shqipëri, ashtu si në botë, po shndërrohet në shqetësim mbipesha (sidomos në moshën shkollore) dhe problematika të tjera shëndetësore që shkaktohen prej saj, të cilat, nëse nuk trajtohen mund të shndërrohen në sëmundje të shumta kronike, si në moshë të re edhe në moshë të rritur. Ushqyerja konsiderohet e shëndetshme kur sasia dhe llojshmëria e ushqimeve të marra janë të përshtatshme për të plotësuar nevojat e organizmit me të gjithë lëndët ushqyese në sasitë e nevojshme për funksionimin normal, rritjen dhe mirëmbajtjen e organizmit. Procesi i ushqyerjes është përcaktuar si aksesi fizik, ekonomik dhe social për ushqim të sigurt, të mjaftueshëm dhe të ushqyeshëm, që plotëson kërkesat dietike për një jetë aktive dhe të shëndetshme. Prandaj mossigurimi i ushqimit është mungesa e aksesit për ushqim të mjaftueshëm, të sigurtë dhe të ushqyeshëm, dhe për pasojë është moskonsumimi i ushqimit të kërkuar për një rritje dhe zhvillim normal dhe për një jetë aktive dhe të shëndetshme.",250,False,False,False,False,0.0

Kjo mund të vijë si shkak i mungesës së ushqimit të disponueshëm, i fuqisë blerëse të pamjaftueshme, i shpërndarjes së papërshtatshme apo i përdorimit të papërshtatshëm të ushqimit në nivel familjeje.

Nënushqyerja përpara moshës 2-vjeçare shkakton dëmtime mendore dhe fizike të pakthyeshme, me pasoja në shëndet, në aftësi për punë dhe në mirëqenien ekonomike në të ardhmen.

Është provuar shkencërisht që faktorët e mësipërm që karakterizojnë një mënyre jetese jo të shëndetshme, janë shkaqet kryesore në proceset e zhvillimit, përparimit dhe të ndërlikimeve të lidhura me pjesën më të madhe të sëmundjeve kronike jo të transmetueshme (SKJT): sëmundjeve kardiovaskulare dhe diabetit, disa tipeve të kancerit, disa sëmundjeve kronike të mushkërive, obezitetit, osteoporozës dhe llojeve të tjera të sëmundjeve muskulo-skeletike. Mungesa e aktivitetit fizik dhe dietat jo të shëndetshme janë të lidhura ngushtësisht me zhvillimin dhe persistencën e faktorëve fiziologjikë të riskut në lidhje me SKJT-të, si për shembull: presioni i lartë i gjakut dhe ndryshimet patologjike të nivelit të yndyrnave në gjak (veçanërisht niveli i lartë i kolesterolit dhe i sheqerit në gjak).

Nevoja për kontrollin e cilësisë së ushqimit dhe shërbimeve që promovojnë dhe mbështesin ushqyerjen e shëndetshme shndërrohet në prioritet kombëtar, në konsideratë të sfidave të mëdha botërore si, globalizimi, urbanizimi, pabarazitë, krizat mjedisore, epidemitë shëndetësore (si p.sh., COVID-19) dhe emergjencat humanitare - duke paraqitur sfida kritike për ushqyerjen tek fëmijët e sotëm dhe tek brezat që do të vijnë. Domosdoshmëria e njohjes dhe ndërgjegjësimit të strukturave arsimore dhe strukturave të kujdesit shoqëror dhe mirëqenies së fëmijëve, edhe pse i nevojshëm, shkon përtej qëllimit dhe mundësive objektive të këtij studimi.

It is not merely the absence of mental illness. Mental illness, psychopathology, or mental health problems refer to the negative aspects of mental health, such as symptoms (or clinical diagnosis) of depression, anxiety or any other disorder that might be diagnosed using current medical guidelines. Mental health and personal well-being enable children and adolescents to reach their full potentials, to experience purposeful relationships, to cope and adapt with the challenging life circumstances. Various studies show that children encounter first mental health challenges for in early childhood. The absence of parental care can lead to more serious consequences that become difficult to recover during adulthood. These consequences become irreversible and can lead to serious situations in adulthood. Early intervention and prevention in children and adolescents is essential to ensure positive mental health outcomes and well-being throughout life. The child mental health and personal wellbeing defines their childhood experience and impacts their ability to live a long and contributing life.

The so-called new sociology of childhood argues that childhood should be treated as a stage in life with its own value and not just a passage to adulthood. Mental health and impairment of personal and developmental well-being are considered common causes of illness and disability in children and adolescents. World data shows that 10% of children and adolescents experience a mental disorder; and, about 50% of all mental health disorders begin prior age of 14. These problems appear to have long-term consequences not only with regards to of children and adolescents mental health, but also for the families and broader, for the national economy. However, most of these cases are not recognized, and consequently, not treated.

This study focuses on adolescent health-related behaviours in a large number of countries. Being a fully-fledged member of this project has also made it possible to follow a periodic cycle of conducting this study, a cycle that is suggested and mandatory for all members of this network. This periodicity is applied every 4 years on the basis of the use of a standard questionnaire, as a survey instrument, distributed by the project management office in all member states. The International Protocol is reviewed during each survey cycle in preparation for the next phase of data collection. Following review, existing items may be retained, modified or replaced. New topics may also be introduced The use of an international-prototype questionnaire, unique to all member countries, with minor adjustments to the health-educational specificities of our country (and every other member) is a necessary condition for carrying out this study.",247,True,False,False,False,0.0

New topics may also be introduced The use of an international-prototype questionnaire, unique to all member countries, with minor adjustments to the health-educational specificities of our country (and every other member) is a necessary condition for carrying out this study. Consequently, the questionnaire at hand, which is the main research instrument applied in Albania, is identical to the one used by all member states. At the same time, the questionnaire is the same as the questionnaire used from the beginning of the study for our country until today. This fact makes it possible to compare data and draw conclusions about the behaviours of school-aged children between different countries applying this project, as well as to compare these data across different time periods within the same country, pointing to behavioural changes, as well as developmental trends for different behaviours in adolescents. Such data make it possible to anticipate adolescent behavioural developments with sound government policies in their respective countries, favouring the success of these policies and achieving national-level objectives. Albania has become part of the network of countries participating in the HBSC study since 2007. In 2009, our country participated in the HBSC 2009-2010 study, along with 43 other countries from Europe and North America.

The focused review was carried out by the team of international experts led by the WHO Regional Office for Europe, Robert Koch Institute, and the WHO Country Office in Albania with the active participation of the national and international stakeholders involved in HIV prevention and control. Albania experiences a low-level HIV epidemic, with HIV prevalence in the adult general population 0.04%.

There is significant geographical variation in HIV burden in the country, predominantly affecting the central part with the capital city and western part of the country. Almost three in four reported new HIV diagnoses are in the male population and the most affected age group is 25-39 years. 72% of new HIV reported cases in 2022 were diagnosed late, with CD4 cell counts below 350 per mm3, including 50% with advanced HIV infection (CD4 below 200 per mm3) at the time of HIV diagnosis. Between 2019 and 2023 the largest numbers of new HIV diagnoses were reported in men with reported heterosexual transmission (39,5%), followed by men who have sex with men (MSM) (26,6%) and women (26,0%). People who inject drugs (PWID) and mother-to-child-transmission accounted for 1,0% and 1,8% of the diagnoses, respectively.

It prioritises HIV prevention among key populations, universal access to treatment, increasing quality of services, removing barriers and improving enabling environment. The HIV response has been increasingly funded by the government and there is a transition of prevention component planned from the funding of the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria. However, disruptions related to the COVID-19 pandemic had an impact on the results and transition. Most of the HIV response is funded by domestic resources, except the prevention component, which has been funded by external donors. To support transition to domestic funding and contribute to sustainability of community-led response, a number of legal documents have been amended, standards for provision of services to key populations have been endorsed. However, the social contracting mechanism still is not functioning. There are certain legal barriers limiting application of procurement procedures for commodities and medications needed for HIV response.

Opioid Agonist Maintenance treatment (OAMT) coverage remains low, at less than 15% of an estimated number of people with opioid dependence. The enabling environment plays an important role for people living with HIV (PLHIV) and key populations (KPs) to access prevention services, including imperfections of the legal and policy framework and their influence on the national HIV measures. Stigma and discrimination towards PLHIV and key populations is still very high. There are continuing efforts to decriminalise behaviours of specific key populations. HIV prevention and screening services are decentralised and provided throughout the country by nongovernmental organisations and governmental institutions. There is a very low number of HIV tests performed (6 per 1000 population, 2022), one of the lowest in the region. HIV treatment and care is centralised and available in the capital city of Tirana.

Within the public health care sector, HIV and STI testing were available at 13 voluntary counselling and testing centres (VCTCs), covering all 12 prefectures. Besides the public sector, testing services were also offered at private laboratories and hospitals/clinics, as well as through NGO services (at both fixed and mobile testing points) for the respective target populations. Despite the large network of testing sites, the number of tests per population is one of the lowest in the region (9 tests per 1000 population in 2022). The treatment cascade shows slow progress towards the 95-95-95 targets. Based on UNAIDS estimates (Spectrum 2022) there were 1500 PLHIV in Albania, of whom 86% knew their HIV status, 65% were on ART, and no data for the third target was available. Challenge arises in linkage to care, as well as keeping people on treatment, particularly for patients residing outside Tirana. Despite the availability of viral load testing, the testing process is frequently interrupted. The lack of integration of HIV polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing at the University Hospital introduces inefficiencies in the diagnostic workflow and treatment monitoring.

The unavailability of medications for severe opportunistic infections (OIs) poses a considerable obstacle to comprehensive patient care. Prescription challenges faced by hospital doctors, particularly in prescribing essential medications like antibiotics, OI prophylactic treatment, (e.g., Cotrimoxazole, Doxycycline), contribute to additional financial burdens for patients. In 2020-21 the COVID-19 pandemic impacted the delivery of HIV services in Albania as well. HIV services and communities have continuously adapted in response to COVID-19 and used the opportunity for bringing innovative service delivery approaches including multi-month dispensation of ARV, remote consultations, and increased use of rapid-diagnostic tests (RDTs). Recommendations The following high priority actions for the Republic of Albania have been identified and recommendations are provided for each area. Medium and low priority actions are included in the relevant sections.

Therefore, this document will address the food standards requirements and suggestions as well as institutional responsibilities from the perspective of food safety and consumer protection. Albania has approximated to a certain extend the EU acquis in the area of food safety but it seems that the regulatory framework on food standards and especially in school settings is still missing even though there are already some initiatives and schemes taking place on school food programmes. Executive Summary The Convention on the Rights of the Child, which is ratified by the Republic of Albania, requires the States Parties to ensure the child such protection and care as is necessary for his/her well-being and take all appropriate legislative and administrative measures. With regard to economic and social rights such measures shall be undertaken to the maximum extend of available resources. The Convention highlights the importance of protection in the areas of safety and health and requires States Parties to ensure that the institutions, services and facilities responsible for the care or protection of children shall conform with the standards established by competent authorities, the number and suitability of their staff as well as competent supervision.",217,False,False,False,False,0.0

Kur OBSH rekomandoi përdorimin e PrEP oral me bazë TDF për njerëzit në rrezik të konsiderueshëm për HIV në 2015, ofrimi i PrEP ishte kryesisht i kufizuar në studime dhe projekte në shkallë të vogël dhe vende me të ardhura të larta. Duke pasur parasysh përvojën e kufizuar, OBSH përpiloi një udhëzim që bazohej kryesisht në praktikën me provat klinike dhe konsensusin e ekspertëve. Që nga viti 2015, ka pasur një përfshirje globale të PrEP në udhëzimet kombëtare dhe zbatim të gjerë të shërbimeve PrEP.

Megjithatë, kur merret parasysh se kush mund të përfitojë nga PrEP, është e rëndësishme të merren parasysh karakteristikat dhe sjelljet e individëve dhe partnerëve të tyre që mund të çojnë në ekspozimin ndaj HIV.

Other examples are new laws such as Law No. 121/2016 on social care services and Law no. 22/2018 on Social Housing, which includes specifically older people.

These programs can delay, reduce, or eliminate the reliance upon institutional residential services, a more expensive option.

The population of Albania, as of January 1st, 2019 numbered 2.862,427 inhabitants by suffering a decrease of 0.3 per cent compared with the figures of January 1st, 2018. The fertility rate has declined from 2.97 in 1990 to 1.7 in 2017 (World Bank data) and is projected to decrease even further, whereas life expectancy has increased for both men and women. The trends for people to live longer and for families to have fewer children are changing the shape of the old-age dependency ratio (i.e. the population age 65 and over divided by the population ages 15-64 which represents the working population). This ratio has risen steadily, from 9.5% in 1992 to 18.48% in 2016 (World Bank data), and it is expected to increase even further. Life expectancy for the period 2016-2020 is 17.5 and 16.6 years for the age 65; also 6.8 and 6.3 at 80 years of age, approximately the same as the period 2011-2015.

This is a clear indication of the complete transformation of society in only 20 years. According to updated projections, the population of Albania by 2031 is calculated to be 2,745.996 inhabitants. This number is almost 36 thousand inhabitants less when compared to the number of population for the Population Projections 2011-2031.

Positive trends in employment rates and participation of women/young women in the labor market were interrupted by COVID-19, leading to job losses and decrease of number of labor force. Therefore, immediately after overcoming the emergency situation, the Government of Albania took measures to address unemployment, especially among young people. The Youth Guarantee Program aimed at including in the labor market of young people not in education, employment, vocational training, increasing the level of the minimum wage, reducing the gender gap in wages, or engaging in Global 6 Accelerator for Decent Work and Social Protection for Just Transitions, aiming at creating jobs and the development of skills in the main sectors of the environmental economy and digitalization, etc., are some of the concrete examples of measures undertaken to progress towards inclusive development, shared prosperity and decent work.

Executive Summary The period under review is marked by a major event for Albania - the first intergovernmental conference for EU accession negotiations took place in July 2022. The start of accession negotiations during a period of accession fatigue and increasing conditionality is not only an achievement in itself but also a reflection of the country’s pursuit of painful reforms in the crucial areas of democratization, economy and governance. Reform progress has been particularly notable in the area of the rule of law, which has traditionally been an area resistant to change, and has become a focus of EU conditionality. The election of a president in 2022 from the ranks of professional civil servants, without links to politics, promises to finally bring to office a person who can stand above the parties, improve the system of checks and balances, and reduce interinstitutional fights and polarization. A major judiciary reform started in 2016 has also continued, with the extension of the vetting process and the completion of new structures, such as those focused on high-level corruption. However, institutional frictions, political polarization, counter-productive political fights, the widespread patronage system and scarce resources in general are still holding back some of the ongoing reforms.

The country has pursued reforms and improved important indices of monetary and fiscal stability, the welfare system and sustainable development. The price hikes, which reached a historic high in July 2022, have prompted the government to allocate about 2% of GDP to support pensioners, vulnerable households, farmers and transport companies. The central bank has also embarked on a gradual policy of normalization, raising the policy rate. Importantly, the Albanian economy has shown resilience, rebounding more than expected following a major earthquake and the COVID-19 pandemic. Real GDP growth climbed to 8.1% in 2021 and 6% in 2022; as a result of the higher GDP denominator, the public debt declined from a peak of 74.5% of GDP in 2020 to 73.1% in 2021.

The actual opening of accession negotiations has given impetus to the government’s efforts to strengthen steering capability, resource efficiency and international cooperation. However, many of the country’s achievements are still a work in progress, and the overall effort remains a work in progress. A major challenge that cuts across almost all areas of reform is the strong role of the international community in the process and the lack of full local ownership. For example, the ongoing judiciary reform has been almost entirely drafted, negotiated, funded and supervised by international actors. As of now, it is still not clear whether the country will manage to sustain the current reform after the unavoidable withdrawal of its international sponsors. History and Characteristics of Transformation The legacies of the communist regime and the chaotic regime change in the early 1990s are often cited as the most important determinants of Albania’s difficulties in consolidating democracy, a market economy and good governance. The communist regime that ruled the country for over 40 years (1944 - 1991) was one of the most unorthodox dictatorships in the communist world. Utilizing Stalinist tactics of repression, the regime eradicated all forms of opposition, preventing the development of organized movements and the emergence of experienced leaders capable of leading a transition to democracy.",232,True,False,True,True,0.0

Utilizing Stalinist tactics of repression, the regime eradicated all forms of opposition, preventing the development of organized movements and the emergence of experienced leaders capable of leading a transition to democracy. The regime’s fall in the early 1990s came amidst tumultuous and occasionally violent protests, leaving behind a population profoundly skeptical of governmental institutions, as well as a crumbling economy, divisive politics and a dearth of individuals dedicated to democracy. Albania’s challenging transition was predictably characterized by a significant institutional crisis and the disintegration of the state. In January 1997, Albanian citizens took to the streets to protest against the “anti-communist” government, which had deteriorated into a one-man rule relying on the country’s security forces and a personally controlled patronage system to solidify a system reminiscent of the previous one-party rule. The economic transition was mishandled, exemplified by pyramid schemes, corrupt privatization and illicit trade with the former Yugoslav states (under embargo at the time), which undermined the impact of initial economic reforms. The Ponzi schemes that flourished from 1995 to 1996 came to be emblematic of the country’s early post- communist economic development.

BTI 2024 | Albania 5 Albania thus had to start once again amid an acrimonious political atmosphere, a polarized society and the absence of state authority, this time without even minimal social and security services. International intervention was necessary to bring about any sense of normalcy and to jump-start institution-building. However, alliances between key political structures, powerful businesses and organized crime flourished during this chaotic and unruly period, fostering state capture and the strength of a patronage system that has played a major role in the country’s transition. Consecutive governments continued to exploit power and use the state as a piece of property to distribute among family members and political cronies as a means of consolidating their hold on power. Not surprisingly, for more than two decades, the country saw a boom in illegal activities - electricity theft, occupation of public spaces, illegal construction, widespread corruption, abuse of the taxation system and a “solve it yourself” type of behavior - tolerated by party bosses.

The post-communist Albanian state has gradually consolidated an institutional framework regulating state-church relations that insists on separation between and independence of the two, but also entails collaboration on some matters. The model ensures equality among four traditional communities - Sunni, Bektashi, Christian Catholic and Christian Orthodox - which enjoy autonomy in running their administrative and spiritual affairs within a constitutionally defined framework of rights and restrictions.

A significant number of Albanians, including opinion makers, politicians and citizens, demonstrate support for the Albanian secular system and the exclusion of religion from the public sphere. Centralized organizations representing each of the four communities also tend to back the institutional separation and independence between the state and religious communities. Attempts by different transnational movements to introduce alternative models and ideals, including radicalized ideologies, have encountered resistance among post-communist Albanians.

While many health risks are influenced by climate, it is expected that projected climate change will also affect health. Rising air and water temperatures and more intense extreme events are expected to affect human biological capacity for adaptation. They will affect, as well, food and water safety, increasing exposure to vector, food, and waterborne infectious diseases. Transmissible or not transmissible heat related diseases and deaths may also increase. Changes in temperature and precipitation increase the risk of air pollution. Additionally, exposure to heat waves, floods, landslides, droughts, wildfires, and other extreme events related to climate change may affect general well-being and create stresses for mental health. Climate doesn’t threaten health only by direct exposure. It also depends largely on a complex set of vulnerability factors. The IPCC defines vulnerability as predisposition to be affected by climate-related health conditions. It includes three elements: 1) exposure to external stressors (physical, biological, psychosocial etc), 2) sensitivity to be affected by climate variability, and 3) capacity of people, communities or systems to adjust or respond to consequences, their resilience to get prepared and recover from adverse events.",221,True,False,False,False,0.0

In this context, children are particularly vulnerable to extreme weather events, as they have a reduced capacity to regulate their body temperature and also, are not able to protect themselves. RATIONALE FOR THE ASSESSMENT The health and well-being of children will continue to be affected in many ways by a changing climate. Children are uniquely vulnerable to climate change in part because of the natural physiology of developing and growing bodies, with short term and lifelong consequences. Additionally, children’ exposure to risks during a longer period of life adds to their vulnerability compared to adults; the children born today will suffer all their life from the cumulative impact of climate change.

These risks are increased in children who suffer from a chronic illness or who live in unsanitary or contaminated environments. Older babies and toddlers can thermoregulate better, but they are often unable to communicate their temperature discomfort. They rely on caregivers to help them adjust clothing and change their environment (Auger et al). The WHO has presented substantial evidence about the disproportionate vulnerability of children in response to climate change. The diseases likely to be potentiated by climate change are already the primary causes of child morbidity and mortality, including vector-borne diseases, water-borne diseases and air-borne diseases. Research shows that the annual death rate of children under five years old could double in low- income countries by 2050 compared with the decade 2005-2015, in a scenario without effective mitigation of rising carbon emissions (Chapman et al). The increase may undermine gains made in other areas of child health and slow the global development progress towards the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals, which seek to end preventable deaths of children under- five and reduce under-five mortality. Natural disasters and extreme weather events can cause injuries and deaths.

Shortages or contamination of food and water can also compromise health. The suspension of care or school can influence the course or quality of life, as well as physical and mental health (Buka et al). Increasing rates of air pollution include particulate matter from wildfires, smoke and airborne dust linked to climate change, as well as ground ozone, pollens and spores. As air quality deteriorates, rates of respiratory and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality increase, including asthma exacerbations (Guarnieri et al). Air pollution is an environmental cancer risk that the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) classified as a “group 1 carcinogen” in 2013. Children's faster respiratory rate, pulmonary immaturity, and the time they spend outdoors make them more vulnerable to poor air quality than adults. Exposure to air pollution during the prenatal period and early childhood can be particularly dangerous.

Infectious diseases take a disproportionately high toll on children in general, and socioeconomically vulnerable children in particular. A systematic review of the association between temperature and all causes of diarrhea suggested that climate change could be responsible for a substantial portion of diarrhea cases. Specifically, the prevalence of Escherichia coli, Cryptosporidium, rotaviruses, and parasites increases with higher temperatures. Rural areas suffer from higher diarrhea incidence rate among children due to the use of unsafe drinking sources and limited hygiene. Temperature seems to be the most important weather variable associated with diarrhea. On the other hand, climate variability in the form of increased rainfall and humidity correlates with a higher risk of contracting bacterial and viral lower respiratory tract infections among children.

Meanwhile, policies and strategies governing social sectors that deliver services for children do not adequately reflect CEED issues such as resilience to climate change and shock responsiveness.

Hydropower accounts for almost all energy generation, and other renewable sources with high, but underexploited, potential include solar photovoltaic, solar thermal, wind and geothermal energy. Albania is one of Europe’s highest disaster risk countries with its settlements at risk from flooding (river, urban and coastal), landslide, wildfire, earthquake, and snow avalanche. Data and specialized research into climate trends and environmental threats in Albania are limited. Especially limited are data on links between climate and environmental degradation on the one hand, and children on the other. This important gap is discussed more fully below. Impacts on children Of the global burden of disease attributable to climate change, 88 per cent is borne by children.5 Changes in weather patterns can increase water- and vector- borne disease, and storms, landslides and wildfires expose children to infections, disability, and even death. Extended heatwaves severely affect particularly babies and young children, causing hyperthermia and cardiovascular disease, as well as gastroenteritis from subsequent unhygienic conditions.6 Vital child health services and ready access to care can be disrupted. Uncertainty in daily life can increase children’s stress and contribute to traumatic experiences, impacting mental health.

Meanwhile, children’s exposure to high levels of air pollution increases greatly the risk of chronic disease such as cardiovascular disease. Extreme weather events damage schools and interrupt education services, impacting access, impoverishing retention and learning outcomes in education that reflect patterns of poverty, geographical disparities, gender inequities and disability. During heatwaves, which are now likely to extend beyond the summer months, schools may be without adequate ventilation or cooling. Climate-induced degradation of livelihoods and food insecurity, particularly in poverty-prone, remote areas can increase the incidence of child marriage, threatening girls’ completion of basic schooling. 5.

Albania possesses a long coastline on the Adriatic Sea (Figure 1) and a mountainous interior. The country transitioned to an open market economy and political pluralism in the early 1990s. In 2009, it joined North Atlantic Treaty Organization and applied for membership of the European Union (EU). Over the last 20 years, its economy has grown rapidly, and Albania is now classified as an upper middle-income country, with a Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita of US$8,367 and a GDP annual growth rate of 3.4 per cent.7 FIGURE 1. MAP OF ALBANIA8 Albania has a population size of 2.4 million (2023), having dropped by some 420,000 since 2011.9 A significant number of Albanians, mostly male youths, live and work abroad.

Albania is a transit and destination country for migrants and refugees, including significant numbers of Afghans and Syrians seeking entry into Europe. Tourism is the fastest growing component of the country’s economy, with more than 10 million visitors in 2023, more than four times the country’s population size.11 Most visitors go to beaches in the coastal regions, with an increasing number visiting the interior of the country, including for ecotourism in forested areas and the country’s 14 national parks. Other important components of the economy include agriculture, which employs a third of the workforce, services, manufacturing and hydroelectricity exports. The Albanian economy and society as whole were severely tested by the devasting November 2019 earthquake, the most damaging in the country for 99 years, and the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic just a few months later.

In Albania, the availability of analyses on how climate change affects women and men differently is limited. According to a survey conducted for the Fourth National Communication (4NC), 39.0 per cent of respondents believe there are differences in men’s and women’s ability to react to climate change.5 So far, analysis in this area has focused mainly on agriculture, which is labor-intensive with women heavily involved. Agricultural production and arable land in Albania are highly dependent on environmental conditions, and they also are the first to be affected by waste treatment processes such as incineration. For example, the decrease in agricultural production recorded in the Verri Village of Fier in Albania was found to be related to the impact the nearby incinerator had on the surrounding arable land. This concern was addressed especially by the women of this area, who felt the direct consequences of the incinerator on their livelihood.6 Furthermore, the 4NC survey identified an increase in time-use for main household chores and enhanced violence against women as the main impacts of climate change on women’s lives.",247,True,False,False,False,0.0

These gender-specific impacts intersect with those that are related to ethnicity, location (especially in areas with more vulnerable populations), poverty, and migration status.8 The waste management cycle is another area where gender differences are prevalent. These differences are defined by women’s primary household responsibilities and depend on varying perceptions on what is waste and what is not, and on women’s and men’s different consumption behaviors. Waste and wastewater treatment processes impact production, industrial pollution, and household behavior with different consequences for women and men.

Traditional gender roles in rural Albania shape these differences, as women, often primary caregivers, maybe more attuned to safety but lack the financial resources to act. Additionally, only 4% of women and 11% of men confirmed access to timely humanitarian aid, highlighting gender disparities in aid distribution.

JEL codes: G01, E58, Q54. Climate change has far-reaching impacts, both in breadth and magnitude that are starting to affect the economy and society in Albania. Mitigating them and positioning the Albanian economy on a sustainable path requires important structural transformations and investments. The Bank of Albania (BoA) has a role to play in this process, both as a monetary policy maker and as a financial supervisor. This policy brief discusses the economic and financial consequences of climate change in Albania as well as the policy options available to the BoA to address them. It suggests a possible roadmap for the central bank in this context.

To mitigate these impacts, profound changes in the Albanian economy are necessary, involving significant investments in transition and mitigation activities and infrastructures. These investments present both risks and opportunities for the Albanian economy and can only be unlocked by the coordination of public and private financial institutions, including the Bank of Albania (BoA). The BoA can play a role part both as financial supervisor and as monetary policymaker. First, the BoA must ensure the financial system's resilience to climate shocks. It can also contribute to creating adequate financial market structures and conditions for Albanian financial institutions to fund the opportunities of the transition to a net-zero economy. Second, the BoA must assess and manage its own exposure to climate risks, resulting from the assets it owns from monetary policy operations. This policy brief outlines a possible roadmap for the BoA to address all these challenges. Climate economic and financial risks and opportunities in Albania The transition to a net-zero economy and the impacts of climate change pose two types of risks for the Albanian economy and for its financial system: physical and transition risks. The materialization of these risks can have significant socio-economic consequences for Albanian firms and households, possibly resulting in financial impacts that can affect the soundness of financial institutions and the financial system.",242,False,False,False,False,0.0

The materialization of these risks can have significant socio-economic consequences for Albanian firms and households, possibly resulting in financial impacts that can affect the soundness of financial institutions and the financial system. In this section, we present a preliminary assessment of climate risks in Albania and their consequences for financial institutions. Albania is particularly vulnerable to physical risks such as floods, droughts, heat waves, and wildfires, according to the World Bank report of 2021. The coastal zones, the agricultural and energy sectors, and water resources are particularly at risk. Albania is already experiencing the effects of climate change with increasing temperatures and declining precipitation levels. These trends are expected to continue, leading to more frequent and acute weather events that can exacerbate other socio-economic risks. Transition risks are also material. Albanian authorities have committed to transitioning to a sustainable economy and have taken significant steps in this direction, including signing the 2030 UN SDGs, the Paris Agreement and the Western Balkan Green Agenda outlined during the 2020 Sophia Summit. The country has also established a National Energy and Climate Plan and several other plans and frameworks to support the transition. However, challenges in terms of financial and institutional capacity remain on the path of this transition.",245,True,False,True,False,0.0

However, challenges in terms of financial and institutional capacity remain on the path of this transition. The transition to a net-zero economy requires major transformations across all sectors of the Albanian economy, in particular in the energy and transport sectors. This transition presents both risks and opportunities: it generates potential economic difficulties for businesses relying on fossil-fuel consumption but it represents new growth opportunities for emerging sustainable economic activities. This is also true for the financial sector. On the one hand, financial institutions are exposed to both physical and transition risks. Extreme weather events (particularly floods and droughts) and changes in temperature and precipitation can impact the financial capacities of Albanian firms and households, potentially resulting in losses for banks. Similarly, firms and households involved in economic activities about to disappear with the transition will also see their financial situation worsen, potentially affecting the banks they do business with. It is crucial for financial institutions to assess these risks, implement risk management measures, and communicate them effectively to financial authorities and investors.

The EU Green Deal and the Green Agenda for the Western Balkans present opportunities for green financing and inclusive growth in Albania. The financial sector can play a key role in promoting sustainability, together with mitigating climate risks, by providing green loans, exerting stewardship over corporates, and exploring partnerships with private sector actors. The transition to a more sustainable economy is a challenge, but also a unique opportunity for the Albanian financial sector to support inclusive and sustainable growth and moving early in the transition is crucial for capturing these opportunities.

At the global level, in 2016, Albania committed to the 2030 UN SDGs and to meeting NDCs under the Paris Agreement. It has since updated its NDCs, demonstrating increased ambitions and efforts to address climate challenges. The Albanian government is also aligned with the SDGs and has integrated its NDCs into its national adaptation plan processes and policy frameworks. Sustainable finance is key in mobilizing the financial resources for transition and mitigation investments. Sustainable finance is still very new in Albanian financial markets. Policy awareness on green finance is however growing among local authorities and the Albanian financial sector has started to acknowledge the importance of assessing and addressing climate-related financial risks to be resilient, support climate transition, and better inform market participants. Leading Albanian banks have begun integrating environmental factors in their business operations.

The BoA is actively participating in various national, regional and international fora’s to better assess and manage the economic and financial impact of climate change. This includes, inter alia, its membership to the Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS) since 2020, its collaboration with the Swiss State Secretariat for Economic Affairs, with the Vienna Initiative, and with the World Bank (FinSAC).

The BoA should move quickly on this roadmap to keep pace with similar countries, but also because of the commitment by Albania to environmental objectives but, foremost, to seize the opportunities that European investments for the transition offer to Albanian businesses and financial institutions. In addition, the presence of European banks in Albania might increase the need for an alignment of Albanian banks’ practices and disclosure regarding climate on international standards. The roadmap is centred on three building blocks (phases) common to seven parallel work streams, each with a specific policy objective (see Table 1). Climate Risks in Albania and their Relevance to the Central Bank www.suerf.org/policynotes SUERF Policy Brief, No 541 5 Phase 1: Stocktaking As a first step, the BoA must better understand the economic and financial implications of climate change and the transition on the economy and the financial sector. This requires, inter alia: • Analysing the relevant channels from climate change and the transition to Albanian firms and households, as well as to financial institutions. • Designing transition scenarios that are relevant for Albania for assessing possible transition pathways. • Engaging with financial institutions to better understands their practices when it comes to climate risk management and the development of sustainable financial solutions.",246,True,False,True,False,0.0

The objective of this phase is to build up the resources and knowledge necessary to start preparing and implementing the BoA’s policy response to address climate risk and support the Albanian economy and financial sector in seizing the related opportunities. Phase 2: Preparation In a second step, the BoA must better analyse the available policy options and develop the tools and resources that are necessary for their implementation. This requires, inter alia: • Integrating climate change and the transition in the models and projections that are used for policy decisions. • Developing prudential regulation and monetary policy options that contribute to addressing climate risk and support businesses and households in the transition. • Refining assessments of risk and opportunities for the financial sector, as well as setting expectations on their practices regarding climate issues. • Establishing reliable and comparable data for policymakers and investors, as well as disclosure standards, based common international definition of sustainable finance.",241,True,False,False,False,0.0

Phase 3: Implementation In the final step, the BoA implements the policies developed in the previous phases. These policies are of different types depending on each work stream: • Monetary policy: integration of climate-augmented models and forecasts in the regular monetary policy decision process. • Financial supervision: setting and monitoring supervisory expectations relative to climate risk management practices and adoption of sustainable finance solutions. • Prudential regulation: implementation of financial regulation to address climate change risks and support transition in the financial sector. • Stress test: performing stress tests to improve banking sector understanding of and resilience to climate risks.

Despite the impact of the global economic downturn, the country remained resilient and grew close to 6 per cent on average in the post pandemic years, on the back of record tourism seasons. However, Albania's convergence with EU standards remains slow, with living standards below EU averages, highlighting persistent gaps. Albania shares some structural challenges with its Western Balkan peers, such as high youth unemployment and slow labour productivity growth. Notwithstanding efforts to boost economic complexity through foreign investment, Albania remains a net importer of goods, with low- complexity exports in sectors like clothing, mining, and agriculture. Despite stable and well capitalised banking sector, lending to private sector in Albania is lagging Western Balkan peers. Albania, with a lower carbon intensity than its peers, relies predominantly on hydropower as its primary electricity source.

There is a heightened concern for the country’s export-oriented value chains, as export markets often face stricter standards. This concern extends to the Medicinal and Aromatic Plants (MAPs) value chain, for which there is a special focus in the report. On the other hand, the agrifood sector is also one of the main contributors to climate change and environmental pollution. Thus, reducing the negative impact of agriculture on climate change and ensuring compliance with environmental standards is crucial. The report is based on secondary and primary data - the latter consisting of surveys targeting agriculture (extension) experts and MAPs farmers. The report highlights significant shifts in climate patterns across various phenomena, presenting a concerning outlook for the agricultural sector in Albania. During the last decade, agriculture experts and farmers have witnessed a higher flooding frequency, hail frequency and drought durations, with an adverse impact on certain agricultural activities. Additionally, the population dynamics of pests and diseases have increased, indicating growing challenges for agricultural production in terms of both yields and adherence to quality (and safety) standards.

Challenges hindering the farmers’ ability to respond to climate change include limited access to resources, knowledge gaps, and inadequate government support. Strengthening extension services, providing financial resources, enhancing awareness and knowledge dissemination, and improving government support policies are crucial steps in overcoming these obstacles and building climate-resilient agricultural systems. Recommendations to enhance climate change adaptation and resilience in the Albanian agricultural sector include improving access to extension services, increasing financial support for implementing adaptation measures, promoting the adoption of climate-smart practices, and providing up-to-date information and advice through suitable platforms.

In its Sixth Assessment Report (AR6), the IPCC found that every increment above 1.5°C would produce far more intense climate impacts. To limit warming to 1.5°C, global greenhouse gas emissions must peak before 2025 at the latest and decline 45% below 2010 levels by 2030. The concept of Common but Differentiated Responsibilities, first coined in the Framework Convention in 1992 and reiterated in the 2015 Paris Agreement, means that a country’s financial and technological capacity, along with its historical responsibility for producing greenhouse gases, affects its share of the global mitigation burden. Ergo, while the world must cumulatively reduce emissions by 45%, some countries can be expected to cut emissions by a lot less than others. The IPCC uses a wide range of integrated assessment models (IAMs) to produce scenarios which assess how the world could feasibly limit warming to the 1.5°C threshold.",225,True,True,True,False,0.0

The IPCC uses a wide range of integrated assessment models (IAMs) to produce scenarios which assess how the world could feasibly limit warming to the 1.5°C threshold. This project first assessed 24 of the IPCC’s 1.5°C compatible scenarios based on compatibility with the Paris Agreement and feasibility considerations (the selection criteria is expanded on in the attached Annex). Then, the scenarios are downscaled to the national level in order to develop a range of 1.5°C emissions pathways for Albania based on the best available science. Each IAM encapsulates a range of different assumptions about how energy, economic and social systems interact with each other as well as with the environment. We highlighted three of these initial 24 scenarios in order to illustrate different approaches (stories) that Albania could take to decarbonise. Policymakers and civil society would then be able to assess which pathways are most appropriate to their national circumstances and use them to develop and interrogate future policy development. At the workshop on 3 April 2024, these pathways were presented to government and civil society stakeholders as a basis for discussion and debate. Subsequently, inputs and critiques from the workshop have been integrated into the pathways analysis to provide a strong input to national stakeholders’ efforts to align Albania‘s climate and energy policy with the science.

Note on Methodology The pathways used in these workshops are taken from the IPCC Sixth Assessment Report (AR6). This report consists of the highest quality climate science and the ‘Statement for Policymakers’ which is agreed on - line by line - by all IPCC member governments, including Albania. IAMs combine models of multiple systems (energy, land-use, economic, climate) to produce scenarios which show how these systems could evolve and interact under different futures. They are valuable tools for understanding the challenges and opportunities associated with limiting global warming to 1.5°C and for guiding efforts to transition to a low-carbon future. We selected pathways which are compatible with the 1.5°C Paris Agreement goal, choosing the most recent pathways in order to represent the latest evidence.",250,True,False,True,True,0.0

We selected pathways which are compatible with the 1.5°C Paris Agreement goal, choosing the most recent pathways in order to represent the latest evidence. Scenarios which rely too much on carbon dioxide removal (CDR) are excluded, as these will almost certainly be impossible to implement in reality due to land use and economic considerations. The IPCC AR6 pathways are global pathways, with emissions scenarios at the world and macro-regional levels. In order to have them at country level, we need to downscale them. We use the Emissions Intensity Convergence method to downscale the emissions, where the emissions intensity of a country (the ratio of emissions per GDP) in the base year (2022) is projected to equal the macro-region’s emissions intensity by 2100. This follows an exponential - rather than linear - path.2 We use this method for all gases and sectors and finally aggregate the results to find a country’s overall GHG emissions. 2 Matthew J.

For a deeper explanation of this project’s underlying methodology, see Annex 1. 1.5°C compatible trajectories for Albania Applying the methodology to Albania allows us to see what emissions reductions are needed to align with the Paris Agreement’s 1.5°C limit. Currently implemented measures, or With Existing Measures (WEM), will lead to emissions of 12 MtCO2e in 2030. This equates to 15% above 2018 levels. Albania’s draft national energy and climate plan (NECP) lays out a 2030 emissions reduction target of 10 MtCO2e, effectively remaining the same as 2018 levels. This is also referred to as ‘WAM’, or With Additional Measures, in Figure 1 as achieving this target would entail additional emissions reduction policies. To be 1.5°C compatible, Albania’s 2030 emissions would be 31-39% below 2018 levels, excluding land use, land use change, and forestry (LULUCF), or 6-7 MtCO2e/yr. Taking the upper (i.e. least ambitious) end of Albania’s 1.5°C range, Albania’s 2030 ambition gap is therefore 3 MtCO2e. By 2050, Albania’s emissions would be 71-80% below 2018 levels, or 2-3 MtCO2e (excl. LULUCF).

Numerous decarbonisation pathways exist, all with their own narratives as to how to enhance climate action and cut emissions. Nevertheless, a common formula exists: a rollout of renewable energy, a fossil fuel phase out, and energy efficiency measures to reduce final energy demand. The precise blueprint, however, can vary and may depend on what is best suited to Albania’s national context, as determined by those involved in the policy process. The three illustrative pathways chosen for this project are the Deep Electrification, Net-Zero Commitments, and Minimal CDR Reliance pathways.

Context: Albania is an upper-middle-income country with a Human Development Index (2019) of 0.795, placing it at 69 out of 189 countries. With over 62 per cent of the population living in urban areas, Albania recognizes nine national minorities, most notably the Roma and Egyptian. Demographics: Due to low birth rates (1.34 fertility rate, 2020) and significant out-migration, Albania’s population has decreased over the last decade.

Albania’s 2010 inclusion in the Schengen visa-free travel throughout the European Union (EU) for short-term visits has further driven out-migration (including a substantial ‘brain drain’ and decreasing number of school-age children). Politics: Recent Albanian politics and reforms are driven by the country’s candidate status for accession into the EU. The wide-ranging accession discussions have placed significant attention on the stability of institutions that guarantee democracy (including judicial and public administration reform, anti-corruption, and fighting organized crime), rule of law, and respect for human rights, and functioning market economy. Should EU accession be achieved, there is an expectation of a further increase of out-migration to other EU countries due to work-visa liberalization, as well as increased economic supports from the EU. Decentralization: Albania is in the early implementation stages of decentralizing core government functions to municipalities, though the rollout is uneven. Budgetary and human resource functions have been slow to follow the municipal mandate and authority to act. Roles and responsibilities between regional and local levels are unclear, and there is inadequate managerial capacity at the municipal level to ensure consistent services for children.

Economy: Albania’s economy contracted in size due to 2019 earthquake and COVID-19. In 2021, Gross Domestic Product (GDP) increased by 8.5 per cent, fully recovering from the recession caused by the pandemic, however, social spending and wages dropped by 0.3 pp of GDP. Uncertainty with regard to the war in Ukraine is affecting price stability and growth, which is expected to slow to 3.2 per cent in 2022. Public debt remains high. Remittances are in decreasing trend, standing at 4.7% of GDP. Poverty: While 21.8% of population was assessed to be at risk of poverty in 2020 (INSTAT, 2020) this figure raises to more than one fourth when it comes to children (28.4%), with girls more affected (30.1%). Evidence shows that households with young children (aged 0 to 5) and teenagers are significantly affected. Based on the World Bank (WB) 2020 data, 43.4 per cent of the population currently live in multi-dimensional poverty. A study in 4 regions showed that almost 82% of Roma and Egyptians belonged to the ‘very poor’ and ‘poor’ groups and that the relative poverty level was twice as high as the majority population.

The effects of COVID-19, including falling income, challenges to pay debts, bills, etc., led many families to barely manage meet the basic needs. COVID-19: The response to COVID-19 has brought dysfunctional state systems to light and has exacerbated inequity. The crisis has negatively impacted education in terms of quality, limited access to services, increased incidence of domestic violence, etc. In general, the taken to mitigate the situation were not adequate. COVID-19 increased the abandonment of children and violence, dramatically reduced the chances of family reunification for children separated from their families, and essentially paused deinstitutionalization efforts. Disaster risk: According to the Index for Risk Management (INFORM) 2022, Albania has high natural disaster risk scores for earthquakes (9.3 out of 10), tsunamis (7.8), and droughts (6.6); whilst lacking infrastructure (2.6 out of 10) and institutional capacities (5.8 out of 10) to cope with the disasters. Albania is vulnerable to changing climate. Children are likely to be acutely impacted by these shifts in climate, but no Climate Landscape Analysis has yet been undertaken. Albania has achieved some level of preparation for climate change, but alignment with the EU acquis is still limited.

The following governance issues that rise to the top in terms of urgency and need for increased action. Address the significant gap between legal/regulatory/policy framework and government implementation driven by corruption, under-funding of government initiatives and uneven political will. Successive governments over years have under-funded health, education, protection and welfare services, which has inevitably eroded infrastructure, stifled innovation, lowered quality standards, and incrementally reduced the fitness for purpose of services. See recommendations in paragraph 15 below. Urgently take measures to mitigate the consequences affecting all service sectors due to the human resource crisis. Many government services, including health, education, and welfare, face significant personnel crises as the existing cohort of qualified and experienced professionals age out of public service. Emigration reduces Albanian’s social capital even further. See also recommendations in clauses 23.a, 42.c, 119.c below. Improve the development and reporting of performance-based outcomes/indicators across government. See recommendations in paragraph 50 below. Develop and implement equity-focused poverty reduction measures. Development gains have been slow, sporadic and uneven, leaving many families disempowered, excluded and struggling to raise their children.

See recommendations in paragraph 79 below. Scale up effectively the de-centralization and de-concentration reforms. There is a need to ensure implementation of recommendations and policies at all levels, from national to municipal. Roles and responsibilities between regional and local levels are unclear, with inadequate managerial capacity. This includes a serious under-devolution of funds from the central to the municipal level. Divergent sectorial approaches and week coordination mechanisms make it difficult to deliver holistic and cost-effective interventions for children. See also recommendation in paragraph 79.b below.

Many Albanians have negative perceptions of and distrust in public authorities, including the police and judicial officials, which deters people from seeking help. Children interviewed in 2015 expressed a vivid distrust in the police in particular, who are viewed as corrupt, violent, and to be feared.

CONTEXT Following the first Intergovernmental Conference on accession negotiations on 19 July 2022, the screening sessions for all six clusters were completed on 24 November 2023. In the context of accession negotiations, Albania submitted the three roadmaps that will guide its reforms efforts. Albania continued to implement the Stabilisation and Association Agreement, and the joint bodies under the agreement met. An intergovernmental conference was convened in October 2024 to open accession negotiations on cluster 1 - fundamentals. The firm political commitment of the Albanian authorities to the strategic goal of European Union integration has been consistently stated as the country’s key priority, and a high level of ambition to move forward in the accession negotiations has been generally maintained. The ongoing accession negotiation process needs to lead to an acceleration of EU-related reforms. Albania maintained its record of full alignment with the EU’s common foreign and security policy. During its term as a non-permanent member of the UN Security Council between 2022 and 2023, Albania actively engaged as a co-penholder of resolutions condemning Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine, aligning with the EU position, including on restrictive measures and sanctions against Russia.

However, its oversight over the executive remains limited. Parliament’s activity was affected by continuous clashes between the ruling majority and a part of the opposition between October 2023 and March 2024. These reflected a lack of constructive and inclusive political dialogue and resulted in opposition MPs causing disruptions due to alleged restrictions on their rights. Despite the welcome return to the normal functioning of Parliament in March 2024, political polarisation remains high. This continues to negatively impact Parliament’s key legislative and oversight roles and extends delays in appointing individuals to key positions. Albania’s bodies in charge of the integration process are in place. These EU integration structures were further consolidated and successfully completed the screening process in November 2023. EU integration expertise, planning and interinstitutional mechanisms will need to be strengthened to be able to cope with the EU accession process.

NARC is a commitment to achieving child rights in Albania between 2021 and 2026. The National Strategy for Development and Integration 2015-2020 (NSDI II), the National Agenda on the Rights of the Child 2017-2020, and a few other important national policies that are interconnected with developments in the area of ensuring child rights were all set to expire in 2020, and the Ministry of Health and Social Protection (MoHSP) has decided to draft the National Agenda on the Rights of the Child 2021 - 2026 based on the need for quality planning.",237,True,False,True,False,0.0

NARC has four strategic goals: (i) good governance to respect, protect, and fulfill children's rights; (ii) the elimination of all forms of violence and child protection; (iii) child and adolescent-friendly systems and services; and (iv) the promotion of children's rights in the digital world. The defined goals allow for the continuation of the previous National Agenda as well as alignment with the European Strategy, which includes the Council of Europe's priorities as well as the current Sophia Strategy. The National Agenda on the Rights of the Child 2021-2026 strives to create a positive environment for children's well-being through access to quality services, positive participation practices, good parenting, the elimination of all forms of violence, and digital development.

Introduction ____________________ When adopted in 1989, the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC) enshrined, for the first time in international law, the recognition of children as subjects of the full scope of civil, political, economic, social, and cultural rights,1 a culmination in the evolution of the concept of childhood and a paradigm shift from the perception of children as the property of their parents. Since then, the Convention became the most ratified international human rights treaty in history and has prompted deep, transformative changes for children across the world, including with support from the United Nations (UN). More children than ever before now have access to health, education, protection, and participation opportunities. Yet, child rights today are often misunderstood, disregarded, or disputed. Despite progress across all regions, children - i.e., all human beings under 182 - are still largely regarded as the objects of adults’ goodwill; mere recipients of services; or solely as a “vulnerable group”, rather than individual subjects of rights and empowered agents in the exercise of their rights. A normative pushback against child rights is taking place globally, including in intergovernmental fora, threatening to undermine the integrity of international standards pertaining to children - for example in relation to gender or civil and political rights.",239,True,False,True,False,0.0

A normative pushback against child rights is taking place globally, including in intergovernmental fora, threatening to undermine the integrity of international standards pertaining to children - for example in relation to gender or civil and political rights. Across the UN system, the rights of children - who make up 30% of humanity3 - are not systematically considered in system-wide or entity-specific policies, strategies and approaches and are generally seen as the exclusive responsibility of a few entities. Against this backdrop and with this guidance note, the Secretary-General of the UN mandates the mobilization of the UN system to collectively strengthen and elevate a shared UN child rights agenda. Systematic attention to child rights is necessary for the UN to be fully inclusive and able to deliver on its mandate across all pillars, including upholding “all rights of all people”,4 achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and ensuring peace and security.",199,True,True,False,True,0.0

For the purpose of this guidance note, child rights mainstreaming is understood as a strategy for making children’s rights, including their meaningful participation, an integral dimension of the design, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of policies and programmes of the UN system, and for assessing the implications for children of any action taken by the UN.5 It covers policies, programmes and actions that are both external and internal/operational.

GUIDANCE NOTE OF THE SECRETARY-GENERAL ON CHILD RIGHTS MAINSTREAMING 3 Child rights mainstreaming involves a recognition that: (1) children are full-fledged rights holders, with a distinct set of rights requiring distinct UN action; (2) children are experts in their own lives and their meaningful participation is necessary for the adequacy and efficiency of UN action; (3) children face specific obstacles in exercising and claiming their rights because of their status as children; (4) child rights are relevant to all advocacy, policies and programmes of the UN across all three pillars (peace and security, human rights, and development) of the UN Charter; and that (5) external and internal UN advocacy, policies and programmes can affect children differently than they affect adults. It also involves a combination of both integrated and targeted actions as follows: (1) making child rights an explicit, systematic, and sustained consideration in new and established processes and procedures, both across the UN system and within entities; and (2) employing targeted interventions to address specific constraints and challenges faced by children.

Guiding Principles ____________________________ 1. Child rights are human rights As all human beings, children are subjects of rights. At the international level, child rights - a term designating the human rights of children - include the rights listed in the CRC and its Optional Protocols; the rights enshrined in international human rights treaties applying to all human beings; and the rights put forth in other relevant international instruments such as the ILO Minimum Age Convention, the ILO Worst Forms of Child Labor Convention and the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children.6 Under these instruments, children are full-fledged rights holders, independently from their parents or guardians.

The instruments establish a direct relationship between the child and the State that challenges the presumption that parents have rights of ownership over the child. As stated by the Committee on the Rights of the Child, “States must see their role as fulfilling clear legal obligations to each and every child. Implementation of the human rights of children must not be seen as a charitable process, bestowing favours on children”.7 The CRC also specifies that States must assist parents and guardians in the performance of their child-rearing responsibilities. 2. Child rights are everybody’s business across all three pillars of the UN “Within the United Nations, human rights must be fully considered in all decision-making, operations and institutional commitments”.8 As child rights are intrinsic to human rights, they are relevant to the work of all entities of the UN system and should constitute an 6 Supplementing the UN Convention against Transnational Organized Crime.",246,True,False,False,False,0.0

All organizational policies, programmes and practices have a role in contributing to the realization of child rights and all entities must be mindful of the implications for children of any action taken under their respective mandates. Accordingly, each UN entity must develop an understanding of how its mandate applies to children, as well as build related capacity. 3.

Children are distinct rights holders with specific set of rights All persons under 18 years old are children and should be considered and treated as children, regardless of their characteristics, status, behavior, or family relationship, or their alleged or perceived involvement in criminal or other offenses, including terrorism-related offenses. Children constitute a group of distinct rights holders under international law,9 whose physical, social, emotional, and cognitive development underpins their evolving capacities -- i.e., the fact that they are gradually gaining maturity and the capacity to exercise their rights independently from adults. It is central and unique to the CRC to simultaneously recognize children as active agents in their own lives, entitled to be listened to, respected, and granted increasing autonomy in the exercise of their rights, while also recognizing their right to be protected from harm and their entitlement for heightened duty of care. Each time that it is relevant, children should therefore be explicitly mentioned, and their specific rights expressly reflected, in all relevant UN strategies, plans, documents and communications, and not be subsumed in other, different groups such as “youth” or “young people”. These terms are not defined by international law and describe a separate demographic with different (sometimes overlapping) rights. Similarly, although girls are often grouped in a single category with women, they in fact should be recognized as a distinct group of rights holders. 4.",230,True,False,False,False,0.0

Child rights are indivisible, interdependent, and interconnected The CRC sets forth the full scope of child rights: civil, political, economic, social and cultural; and child rights, as all human rights, are indivisible, interdependent and interconnected. Therefore, equal attention should be given to all categories of rights and to all rights, including civil and political rights that are particularly neglected and denied but equally central to what it means for children to be rights holders. The UN system should pro-actively safeguard the indivisibility of child rights and promote the realisation of all rights. As with adults, children have the right to be human rights defenders and to be protected when exercising this right.10 The UN system should empower and support the protection of child human rights defenders. 5.

Additionally, the UN system has a responsibility to draw particular attention and resources to the children who are the most discriminated against, as well as to actively combat the erosion of equality in and before the law. 7.

Albania is expected to strategically communicate the benefits and obligations of the accession process to its public. 3 A) INTRODUCTION The enhanced enlargement methodology1, adopted in 2020, put the Fundamentals cluster at the heart of the accession negotiations, as reflected in the Negotiating Framework with Albania. Accordingly, Albania will need to fully embrace and implement reforms in the fundamental areas of rule of law, in particular judicial reform and the fight against corruption and organised crime, fundamental rights, the strengthening of democratic institutions and public administration reform, as well as economic criteria.

In addition, the Copenhagen political criteria require that candidate countries consolidate “stable” democratic institutions before they join the EU. Building on the revised enlargement methodology of February 2020, the functioning of democratic institutions requires a specific structured engagement. To be meaningful and comprehensive, this has been developed along three main pillars: (1) the electoral process, including the functioning of the electoral administration, media in the election campaign and the financing of political parties and election campaigns; (2) the functioning of parliaments in a democratic system; (3) the role of civil society, including the legal, regulatory and policy frameworks for civil society organisations (CSOs), as well as the wider context for an enabling environment.

Active engagement of civil society organizations (CSOs), mainly through joint committees at both national and local levels, is essential to ensure that the integration process is participatory and representative. However, civil society’s role in the EU accession process remains limited, with slow progress in implementing the commitments outlined in the 2019-2023 Roadmap for Civil Society. A comprehensive regulatory framework for public funding of CSOs is still lacking, leaving institutions without standardized procedures or transparent criteria for grant allocation. Despite the presence of the National Council for Civil Society (NCCS) as the main advisory body, the space for meaningful CSO participation remains constrained, with limited opportunities for input and weak follow-up mechanisms. Furthermore, the CSO sector continues to face structural challenges, including fragmentation, donor dependency, and a concentration of activity in urban centers, despite the presence of active grassroots initiatives across the country. The civil society sector in Albania is currently facing significant challenges due to budget cuts from key donors, including the U.S. Government and several EU countries.

The Committee welcomes the pledge submitted by the State party to the Human Rights 75 Secretariat in 2023 in which it prioritises the punishment and prevention of corruption. However, it is concerned that corruption remains prevalent in both the public and private sphere and that preventive measures appear to have a limited impact. The Committee takes note of the efforts of the Special Anti-Corruption and Organized Crime Structure to combat corruption but regrets the difficulties faced in the recruitment process to ensure to be fully staffed, due to a lack of applications from magistrates (arts.",248,True,False,True,False,0.0

Recalling the Committee’s previous recommendations4, the Committee remains concerned that the killing of four individuals in the context of demonstrations in January 2011 have yet to be effectively investigated. Some perpetrators have not been promptly identified nor brought to justice, and victims and their families have not received adequate redress. The Committee is also concerned that, despite the efforts made by the State party to address human rights violations during the dictatorship, the families of victims of enforced disappearances have faced challenges in gaining victim status, such as the need to provide evidence of political persecution.",221,True,False,True,False,0.0

The Committee regrets that the State party has not yet put in place a comprehensive legislative and institutional framework that secures the rights of both the families of forcibly disappeared persons and society at large to know the truth about these violations and has insufficiently informed them about their right to adequate reparations as well as the right to bring criminal cases of enforced disappearance before the courts (arts. 2, 6, 7 14 and 21). 10. The State party should redouble its efforts to expedite and finalize the investigations of the January 2011 demonstrations, identify and prosecute the perpetrators, and if they are convicted, impose penalties commensurate with the gravity of the offences, and ensure access to effective remedies for victims and their families. The State party should also expand the legislative and institutional framework to comprehensively secure the rights to the truth of families of victims of enforced disappearance during the dictatorship; to have the remains of their loved ones identified and returned to them; to have access to justice and obtain reparation, and to guarantee non-repetition, and foster and preserve memory.",250,True,False,True,False,0.0

Non-discrimination 11. The Committee notes with concern discrimination faced by women, Roma and Egyptian communities, persons with disabilities and lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) persons, which implies significant barriers to the full enjoyment of their human rights.

The Committee appreciates the progress made by the State party in enhancing the representation of women in political life, including at the ministerial level and through the 2015 amendment to the Electoral Code, which established a 50% quota for candidates for councillors in local elections.

The Committee is also concerned by the low number of women owning or managing businesses and the difficulties they face in asserting property rights, particularly land rights for women living in rural areas or after the 2019 earthquake. The Committee is concerned by reports of ongoing practices of prenatal sex-selective abortions and by the possibility that the extension of the legal window for abortion from 12 to 14 weeks of pregnancy in the new draft bill on sexual and reproductive health could increase the practice of sex-selective abortions (art. 2, 3, 6, 25 and 26). 14.

Violence against women 15. The Committee is highly concerned about the structural and endemic problem of violence against women in the State party, despite sincere efforts being made to address it, including by the People’s Advocate. The Committee is particularly concerned that victims face numerous obstacles in filling complaints, including lack of confidence in the police or judicial system, fear of re-victimisation, precarious economic situations, and lack of effective access to legal aid.

The government made greater efforts to address police impunity. Compared with all of 2022, in the first 10 months of the year, the Police Oversight Agency (POA) opened more criminal cases (from three to 20); referred more cases for disciplinary action to the Albanian State Police (from 18 to 68); and made more arrests or detentions (42 to 166). POA conducted four investigations into complaints of violence by police, disciplining three police officers and referring another to prosecution.

Political environment Domestic perspective Local Elections held in 2023 are the major political event that has occurred since the adoption of UNICEF Country Programme Document 2022 - 2026. The governing majority has remained unperturbed in the last decade, despite numerous indictments and arrests of key politicians among its own ranks, the restructurings of government and in light of a poorly functioning Parliament. The Socialist Party led by Prime Minister Edi Rama is governing for a third mandate 2013 - 2025, with a comfortable majority in parliament (77 mandates out of 140). While substitution of Ministers has been routine over the last 11 years in power, the reshuffling of the Government has been less frequent. The Government structure was changed after the March 2021 general elections to include, among other a Minister of State for Youth and Children. The structure of the government was reshuffled again in September 2023 to create a Ministry of Economy, Culture and Innovation and a Minister of State for Local Government.",247,True,False,True,False,0.0

The latest unannounced substitution of Ministers in the Government happened on July 28th 2024 concerning Ministers of Interior, Defense and of Finance. Parliament’s oversight of the executive remained limited1. This has continued to negatively affect the Parliament’s key functions of holding the executive accountable through effective scrutiny and of serving as a forum for constructive political debate, as well as its responsibility to elect in a timely manner the heads of key independent institutions. Currently, the Parliament is having difficulties in fulfilling its duty to elect the Ombudsperson. Parliament is still to elect a new Anti-Discrimination Commissioner. Delays and the politicization of these appointment processes weaken these independent institutions, and their interaction with UNICEF. Lack of executive accountability presents difficulties/(impairs) for UNICEF’s advocacy and outreach efforts and addressing the challenges related to fulfillment of its normative mandate.

Political polarization remains a notable feature of the Albanian political scene, with divisions within the opposition persisting. In late July 2024, both the governing Socialist Party (SP) and the main opposition Democratic Party (DP) passed amendments to the Electoral Code. As the May 2025 general elections approach, political tensions may increase. Polls and analysis2 suggest the possibility of the Socialist Party maintaining its position comfortably. A key driver with regard to institutional shaping of social protection, and early education is the Decentralization reform - it is likely to continue and deepen further. Local elections held in May 2023 confirmed the domination of the Socialist Party in the political landscape; the SP took 53 municipalities out of 61 municipalities in total. Some 40 electoral subjects registered, fielding a total of 144 mayoral candidates. Legal provisions require that half of the candidates for municipal councils should be women, however this was fully respected in only 10% of municipalities, indicating a poor culture of law enforcement and gender equity. The participation of young people was particularly low: among 122,545 first-time voters, only 16,628 (13%) cast a vote.

Decentralization efforts call for UNICEF direct attention and involvement to addressing the challenges such a reform contains with regard to the impact on availability and access to social protection and education services at local level. 1 EU - Albania’s Progress Report 2023 https://neighbourhood-enlargement.ec.europa.eu/system/files/2023- 11/SWD_2023_690%20Albania%20report.pdf 2 Projection of Mandate distribution for MPs in the 2025 elections based on data results for Subjects of the May 14 Electoral Process https://ndiqparate.al/?p=19548&lang=en Despite some progress, Albania still remains classified as a transitional hybrid regime or a flawed democracy.

Due to the urgency and unpredictability of both the damages and the social, economic and health consequences caused by the COVID-19 pandemic crisis, it was impossible to conduct in-depth analysis of the impact of financial measures on men and women. These measures to mitigate the crisis consequences are based only on the data available at the time of their preparation. Important measures have been undertaken for the advancement of gender equality in the following fields: employment; reducing and redistributing unpaid care and unpaid work at home; narrowing differences between the genders in the digital field; promoting employment and supporting start-ups, women’s enterprises; social protection including special measures for mother and child protection; the expansion of social care services and specialized support services; improving health outcomes and increasing information on sexual and reproductive health, etc.",206,True,False,True,False,0.0

For example, the fact that many women in agriculture do not have equal rights on ownership of property and assets, partly due to patriarchal practices of land inheritance, affects the achievement of appropriate results in terms of their economic empowerment.

Positive trends in employment rates and participation of women/young women in the labor market were interrupted by COVID-19, leading to job losses and decrease of number of labor force. Therefore, immediately after overcoming the emergency situation, the Government of Albania took measures to address unemployment, especially among young people. The Youth Guarantee Program aimed at including in the labor market of young people not in education, employment, vocational training, increasing the level of the minimum wage, reducing the gender gap in wages, or engaging in Global 6 Accelerator for Decent Work and Social Protection for Just Transitions, aiming at creating jobs and the development of skills in the main sectors of the environmental economy and digitalization, etc., are some of the concrete examples of measures undertaken to progress towards inclusive development, shared prosperity and decent work.

Executive Summary The period under review is marked by a major event for Albania - the first intergovernmental conference for EU accession negotiations took place in July 2022. The start of accession negotiations during a period of accession fatigue and increasing conditionality is not only an achievement in itself but also a reflection of the country’s pursuit of painful reforms in the crucial areas of democratization, economy and governance. Reform progress has been particularly notable in the area of the rule of law, which has traditionally been an area resistant to change, and has become a focus of EU conditionality. The election of a president in 2022 from the ranks of professional civil servants, without links to politics, promises to finally bring to office a person who can stand above the parties, improve the system of checks and balances, and reduce interinstitutional fights and polarization. A major judiciary reform started in 2016 has also continued, with the extension of the vetting process and the completion of new structures, such as those focused on high-level corruption. However, institutional frictions, political polarization, counter-productive political fights, the widespread patronage system and scarce resources in general are still holding back some of the ongoing reforms.

The country has pursued reforms and improved important indices of monetary and fiscal stability, the welfare system and sustainable development. The price hikes, which reached a historic high in July 2022, have prompted the government to allocate about 2% of GDP to support pensioners, vulnerable households, farmers and transport companies. The central bank has also embarked on a gradual policy of normalization, raising the policy rate. Importantly, the Albanian economy has shown resilience, rebounding more than expected following a major earthquake and the COVID-19 pandemic. Real GDP growth climbed to 8.1% in 2021 and 6% in 2022; as a result of the higher GDP denominator, the public debt declined from a peak of 74.5% of GDP in 2020 to 73.1% in 2021. The current account deficit also decreased to 7.7% of GDP in 2021 and to 7% in 2022, BTI 2024 | Albania 4 reaching levels similar to the pre-pandemic average of 7.7%. Still, economic recovery is threatened by the long-term effects of the pandemic, commodity price increases and imported inflation.

The actual opening of accession negotiations has given impetus to the government’s efforts to strengthen steering capability, resource efficiency and international cooperation. However, many of the country’s achievements are still a work in progress, and the overall effort remains a work in progress. A major challenge that cuts across almost all areas of reform is the strong role of the international community in the process and the lack of full local ownership. For example, the ongoing judiciary reform has been almost entirely drafted, negotiated, funded and supervised by international actors. As of now, it is still not clear whether the country will manage to sustain the current reform after the unavoidable withdrawal of its international sponsors. History and Characteristics of Transformation The legacies of the communist regime and the chaotic regime change in the early 1990s are often cited as the most important determinants of Albania’s difficulties in consolidating democracy, a market economy and good governance. The communist regime that ruled the country for over 40 years (1944 - 1991) was one of the most unorthodox dictatorships in the communist world. Utilizing Stalinist tactics of repression, the regime eradicated all forms of opposition, preventing the development of organized movements and the emergence of experienced leaders capable of leading a transition to democracy.",232,True,False,True,True,0.0

Utilizing Stalinist tactics of repression, the regime eradicated all forms of opposition, preventing the development of organized movements and the emergence of experienced leaders capable of leading a transition to democracy. The regime’s fall in the early 1990s came amidst tumultuous and occasionally violent protests, leaving behind a population profoundly skeptical of governmental institutions, as well as a crumbling economy, divisive politics and a dearth of individuals dedicated to democracy. Albania’s challenging transition was predictably characterized by a significant institutional crisis and the disintegration of the state. In January 1997, Albanian citizens took to the streets to protest against the “anti-communist” government, which had deteriorated into a one-man rule relying on the country’s security forces and a personally controlled patronage system to solidify a system reminiscent of the previous one-party rule. The economic transition was mishandled, exemplified by pyramid schemes, corrupt privatization and illicit trade with the former Yugoslav states (under embargo at the time), which undermined the impact of initial economic reforms. The Ponzi schemes that flourished from 1995 to 1996 came to be emblematic of the country’s early post- communist economic development.

BTI 2024 | Albania 5 Albania thus had to start once again amid an acrimonious political atmosphere, a polarized society and the absence of state authority, this time without even minimal social and security services. International intervention was necessary to bring about any sense of normalcy and to jump-start institution-building. However, alliances between key political structures, powerful businesses and organized crime flourished during this chaotic and unruly period, fostering state capture and the strength of a patronage system that has played a major role in the country’s transition. Consecutive governments continued to exploit power and use the state as a piece of property to distribute among family members and political cronies as a means of consolidating their hold on power. Not surprisingly, for more than two decades, the country saw a boom in illegal activities - electricity theft, occupation of public spaces, illegal construction, widespread corruption, abuse of the taxation system and a “solve it yourself” type of behavior - tolerated by party bosses.

During the period under review, the country enhanced the 2017 framework law on the protection of national minorities, implementing new legislation on minority education in 2021 and providing funding for civil society projects that support minority rights in 2022. In 2021, the country passed a National Action Plan for LGBT+ issues for the years from 2021 - to 2027, which incorporates anti- discrimination measures, enhanced access to services, a law on gender recognition, and a national action plan for Roma and Egyptians. State identity 9 BTI 2024 | Albania 7 De facto marginalization and discrimination among specific minority groups, particularly the LGBT+ community and Roma communities in Egypt, reflect the lack of sufficient social services and resources, and, to some extent, a cultural - rather than a legal or institutional - problem. The post-communist Albanian state has gradually consolidated an institutional framework regulating state-church relations that insists on separation between and independence of the two, but also entails collaboration on some matters. The model ensures equality among four traditional communities - Sunni, Bektashi, Christian Catholic and Christian Orthodox - which enjoy autonomy in running their administrative and spiritual affairs within a constitutionally defined framework of rights and restrictions. The institutional settlement excludes any influence of religious dogmas on the legal order and political institutions of the state.",245,True,False,True,False,0.0

The institutional settlement excludes any influence of religious dogmas on the legal order and political institutions of the state. A significant number of Albanians, including opinion makers, politicians and citizens, demonstrate support for the Albanian secular system and the exclusion of religion from the public sphere. Centralized organizations representing each of the four communities also tend to back the institutional separation and independence between the state and religious communities. Attempts by different transnational movements to introduce alternative models and ideals, including radicalized ideologies, have encountered resistance among post-communist Albanians. Radical ideas, if present, are typically limited to marginal groups that operate in more globalized online spaces.

Their combined efforts have been essential to achieving these successes. Significant achievements include two transformative joint programmes financed by the Sustainable Development Goal Fund: Digital Agriculture and Rural Transformation (DART) and Lifelong Empowerment and Protection in Albania. Meanwhile, the country’s first National SDG Roadmap was successfully created, with other initiatives such as the Women Entrepreneurship Expo aiming to foster an inclusive business environment, with six companies joining the UN Global Compact and 38 pledging support for the Women’s Empowerment Principles. Our support for building the country’s human capital focuses on effectively implementing reforms in social care, education and healthcare. Albania’s participation in the Global Accelerator on Jobs and Social Protection for Just Transition underscores its commitment to advancing labour policies, social welfare and inclusive measures for vulnerable groups. Adoption of the Social Protection Strategy (2024-2030) and the Social Inclusion Policy (2024-2028) lays the foundation for enhanced services and the inclusion of vulnerable groups of the population.

Primary healthcare advancement, emergency preparedness and effective public +health management are central to Albania’s health strategy. A transparency portal and a GIS platform aim to improve planning and address infrastructure needs, while vaccination, child nutrition monitoring and emergency preparedness have been improved. Green growth and efforts to combat climate change have driven progress in climate-smart agriculture, vocational education and digital transformation. Employment and skills development initiatives reached thousands of individuals, while work on the green and blue economies saw gender integration in tourism, and the revitalization of Albania’s cultural heritage, with 18 cultural sites benefiting from restoration and upgraded facilities. Implementation of the groundbreaking DART aims to leverage digitalization to advance sustainability goals with systemic interventions aimed particularly at smallholder farmers. The country also advanced in fulfilling its commitments under the Montreal Protocol by implementing systems to phase out ozone-depleting substances and adopting low- global-warming technologies.

The country has made notable progress in advancing gender equality and addressing violence against women and children. Support from the UN enhanced services for survivors of domestic violence, trafficking and other forms of abuse, providing both immediate assistance and long-term empowerment for women and children from vulnerable groups. Gender- responsive budgeting has become an integral part of Albania’s financial planning. As a result, 59 per cent of budgetary programmes for 2025 now incorporate gender-specific objectives, driving more equitable resource distribution and policy implementation.

The first administrative and financial decentralisation reform took place in 1998-2000 with the introduction of a local government in the Constitution, the adoption of the first Decentralisation Strategy, and the new Law 8652/2000 on the organisation and functioning of local government.

During 2003 - 2005 several reforms took place concerning decentralisation of services/functions in education, social services, health, and fiscal decentralisation with further improvement of the intergovernmental transfer system. In 2015, a new Territorial Administrative Reform (TAR) solved the issue of municipal fragmentation, by reducing the number of 373 municipalities and communes into only 61 municipalities. Decentralization in Albania is currently supported by the Decentralization Strategy 2014 -2020, and the updated Action Plan 2020-2022. Furthermore, the Law 139/2015 ""On Self Government"" assigns functions and competencies to the LGUs in Albania in several areas, among which are education, health and especially social services, including child protection. Other sector strategies such as strategy of education, strategy of health, etc., are supposed to support and complement the decentralization reform and the own and delegated functions to LGUs.",174,True,False,True,False,0.0

Conclusions Main conclusions arising from the findings and data which are provided in detail in the different chapters are: Albania has developed a comprehensive policy and strategic framework in social sectors, but they need to be better harmonized and aligned with the strategic and legal framework governing the local government functions. Sector ministries have opted for different approaches when it comes to decentralization and transfer of responsibilities, and such approach has been instituted in the sectoral strategies. Sectorial divergent approaches means that different levels of local governance and local government actors have different degree of responsibilities in planning and managing social sectors at local level, which might pose a challenge for municipalities to plan and coordinate their support to their communities. The delegation of competencies towards the LGs is not always linked to a greater autonomy of local government.",223,False,False,False,False,0.0

The delegation of competencies towards the LGs is not always linked to a greater autonomy of local government. Compared to other SEE countries, Albania is the country where the local government plays an important role in the provision of social services, with involvement in 16 out of 24 social services. Within each area, services are shared between the local government and central gove rnment. However, the provision of assigned functions is hindered due to existing discrepancies between functional assignments and the financial and regulative powers; decision over investments and financial flows remain under the discretion of the central government. This situation is regularly encountered when implementing the decentralized functions, in health, education and social care services all relevant to children. The pace of decentralization of functions i.e., pre-university education, health, and social services relevant to children and the level of inter-government financial transfers are not symmetric; the financial flows are not enough to back up the decentralization of functions.

The decentralization of functions is also hindered by the lack of nationally approved operational standards for most of the functions/services delivered by LGUs.

Improved legislation and policies, in general, face difficulties in measuring their impact on enhancing citizens' life, mainly due to the lack of coherent sectorial data defined by the central level, as well as the lack of information management systems at the local level. The local government units lack a unified data management system that will allow them to collect systematically, as well as human and technical capacities for data processing and analyses. In the framework of strengthening the evidence-based local policy-making system, the municipalities must establish the Units of Performance. There is no clear evidence on the number of municipalities that have established the Performance Unit. Furthermore, human and technical capacities for managing the functions related to children, at the local level are not sufficient and rather mismatched against the geographic distribution of services in health, education and social care and demographic pressures in the municipal centres.

In the context of accession negotiations, Albania submitted the three roadmaps that will guide its reforms efforts. Albania continued to implement the Stabilisation and Association Agreement, and the joint bodies under the agreement met. An intergovernmental conference was convened in October 2024 to open accession negotiations on cluster 1 - fundamentals. The firm political commitment of the Albanian authorities to the strategic goal of European Union integration has been consistently stated as the country’s key priority, and a high level of ambition to move forward in the accession negotiations has been generally maintained. The ongoing accession negotiation process needs to lead to an acceleration of EU-related reforms. Albania maintained its record of full alignment with the EU’s common foreign and security policy. During its term as a non-permanent member of the UN Security Council between 2022 and 2023, Albania actively engaged as a co-penholder of resolutions condemning Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine, aligning with the EU position, including on restrictive measures and sanctions against Russia.

Parliament’s activity was affected by continuous clashes between the ruling majority and a part of the opposition between October 2023 and March 2024. These reflected a lack of constructive and inclusive political dialogue and resulted in opposition MPs causing disruptions due to alleged restrictions on their rights. Despite the welcome return to the normal functioning of Parliament in March 2024, political polarisation remains high. This continues to negatively impact Parliament’s key legislative and oversight roles and extends delays in appointing individuals to key positions.

The technical cooperation support delivered by the 11 UN implementing entities (IEs) using RPTC contributed substantially to Member State capacity development and policymaking. The good quality technical support and expertise enhanced capacity of beneficiaries with new skills, innovative approaches, tools, models, and peer learning between countries. This also contributed to the formulation, revision and implementation of policies, national plans, strategies and laws. Despite these contributions, most IEs had no systematic means in place to evaluate and report on the outcomes of their work beyond the output level. IEs were highly responsive to Member State needs, using RPTC to provide technical expertise in a timely manner. IEs promoted their advisory services to beneficiaries so that they were able to request support from relevant IEs.

Some countries received high volumes of RPTC support across all IEs, while others received comparatively little support. The main value of RPTC was its unique flexibility, enabling IEs to deploy their normative tools and advice in response to Member State technical cooperation requests, often in a catalytic manner. This included generating follow-on funding, demonstrating concepts and tools, galvanizing partners to carry on work, creating networks of good actors, and multi-year support. The IEs effectively managed RPTC overall, employing tailored decision-making models for administering RPTC within their organizations. However, IEs also struggled with similar RPTC management challenges, with no forum for exchanging practices and lessons learned. There were also data gaps on capturing demand and corresponding missed opportunities to improve strategic use. RPTC interventions were mostly coherent with IE and UN country team priorities, although coordination with other UN entities, including through the Resident Coordinator (RC) system, needed strengthening. While IEs had mechanisms for informing RCs about their RPTC work, they were not always engaged with RCs or other UN partners meaningfully. Readily available for responding to requests, and accounting for between one and five per cent of overall IE budgets, RPTC was a cost-effective mechanism for delivering IE expertise to beneficiaries. However, efficiency was hindered by a lack of strategic budget allocation criteria, where increases in budget were distributed based on historical allocations.",246,False,False,False,False,0.0

However, efficiency was hindered by a lack of strategic budget allocation criteria, where increases in budget were distributed based on historical allocations. There were also opportunities to optimize spending on staff and consultant costs, and to improve strategic allocations between IEs. OIOS makes four important recommendations to: a) Create a forum for sharing good practices and lessons learned on RPTC administration, implementation, monitoring, request tracking and outreach; b) Review or develop RPTC guidelines pertaining to post and non-post uses; c) Establish communication with DMSPC on strategic issues of RPTC use; and d) Better assess or evaluate outcomes of RPTC support. 4 I.

The evaluation topic emerged from a programme-level risk assessment described in the evaluation inception paper.2 The evaluation responds to a 2022 General Assembly endorsed request from the ACABQ3 that the Secretary- General conduct “a comprehensive independent review, within existing resources, of the RPTC and present the findings in a separate report during the consideration of the next programme budget.” This is the first evaluation of RPTC undertaken by OIOS-IED. 2.

RPTC was established by the General Assembly in resolution 58 (I) in 1946 to provide technical support to developing countries, least developed countries, countries with economies in transition and countries emerging from conflict. The objective of the programme is to “support and advance processes aimed at developing the capacity of governments, institutions and individuals to formulate and implement policies for sustainable economic and social development”.4 RPTC resources are intended to facilitate “quick responses and initial support by implementing entities and is complementary to other development funds, including the United Nations Development Account (DA) and extrabudgetary (XB) resources”.5 4. The programme has 11 Secretariat implementing entities (IEs), with specialized development expertise and knowledge grouped under sectoral advisory services implemented by global entities, and regional advisory services implemented by the regional commissions, illustrated in table 1. 1 Efficiency analysis provided by OIOS Internal Audit Division (OIOS-IAD) 2 OIOS-IAD recommended in 2018/058, an evaluation of RPTC. 3 ACABQ recommendation V.112 in A/77/7; endorsed in A/RES/77/262. 4 A/77/6 Section 23. 5 Ibid. 5 Table 1: RPTC IE by component 5.

While RPTC does not have any formal lead entity with a supervision or coordination role, the Under-Secretary-General of DESA represents the programme in intergovernmental processes and, until 2023 coordinated the formulation of progress reports. The Programme Planning and Budget Division (PPBD) within DMSPC, under the guidance of the Controller, proposes the distribution of RPTC resources based on past distributions and utilization rates to the GA for their final decision. 8.

RPTC proposed budget programme (Section 23) is approved by the General Assembly on an annual basis and funded through the Regular Budget. The overall resources proposed for 2024 were USD 45 million before recosting and reflected a gradual increase over the last five years (figure 2). 7 Figure 2: RPTC resources and IE proportion, 2020-2024 (thousand USD, percentage of total) 10.

Bora Muzhaqi Minister of State for Youth and Children “We cannot build the future for our youth, but we can build our youth for the future.” - Franklin D. Roosevelt NATIONAL YOUTH STRATEGY 2022-2029 1. Overview and Purpose of the Strategic Document The Government of Albania views this situation as an opportunity to develop and place youth at the center of sustainable development. Precisely for this reason, a State Minister responsible for Youth and Children was established. Increased inter­ governmental cooperation, i.e. cooperation among the local government, donors and other stakeholders, would make this an excellent opportunity. Investments made thus far will encourage Albanian youth to effectively deal with development challenges. In­ vestments will increase effective secondary level education, reduce school violence, create employment opportunities, and lower the rate of child abuse, exploitation, and marriage. They will enable youth to reach their full potential. This strategy aims at mak­ ing the development of youth a matter for youth themselves and create opportunities for youth to make positive changes to their lives, and effectively invest in their future, through increased participation in the country’s life.",238,True,False,True,True,0.0

Regional cooperation and good neighbourly relations remain essential elements of the enlargement process. It is important to continue the dialogue with civil society and other stakeholders, with the aim of ensuring the support of citizens for the EU accession process. Albania is expected to strategically communicate the benefits and obligations of the accession process to its public. 3 A) INTRODUCTION The enhanced enlargement methodology1, adopted in 2020, put the Fundamentals cluster at the heart of the accession negotiations, as reflected in the Negotiating Framework with Albania. Accordingly, Albania will need to fully embrace and implement reforms in the fundamental areas of rule of law, in particular judicial reform and the fight against corruption and organised crime, fundamental rights, the strengthening of democratic institutions and public administration reform, as well as economic criteria.

Economic governance has become even more central in the enlargement process in recent years.  EU rules, under acquis Chapter 5, ensure that public procurement of goods, services and works in any Member State is transparent and open to all EU companies on the basis of non- discrimination and equal treatment.  EU rules require, under acquis Chapter 18, that Member States are able to produce statistics based on professional independence, impartiality, reliability, transparency and confidentiality. Common rules are provided for the methodology, production and dissemination of statistical information.  The EU promotes the reform of national governance systems to improve managerial accountability, sound financial management of income and expenditure, and external audit of public funds.

According to Article 2 of the Treaty on European Union (TEU), the Union is founded on the principles of human dignity, freedom, democracy, equality, the rule of law and the respect for human rights.

In addition, the Copenhagen political criteria require that candidate countries consolidate “stable” democratic institutions before they join the EU. Building on the revised enlargement methodology of February 2020, the functioning of democratic institutions requires a specific structured engagement. To be meaningful and comprehensive, this has been developed along three main pillars: (1) the electoral process, including the functioning of the electoral administration, media in the election campaign and the financing of political parties and election campaigns; (2) the functioning of parliaments in a democratic system; (3) the role of civil society, including the legal, regulatory and policy frameworks for civil society organisations (CSOs), as well as the wider context for an enabling environment.

Internal reposiƟoning measures helped the UNECE to beter posiƟon itself and communicate its ‘oﬀer’ among the UN family at regional and country levels; the UNECE oﬀer can be summed up as: its knowledge and experƟse, based upon the regulatory instruments developed by the inter-governmental sectoral commitees.

Information for these data dimensions was collected from a series of stakeholders - relevant ministries and subordinate institutions, as well as UN organisations, representing both data users and data producers, in addition to the independent desk research performed by the consultants. Both methodology and preliminary results have been validated with the stakeholders involved in data collection. This report is structured into five chapters.

Since its inception in the mid-1990s, the instrument has been continuously developed and contains a large set of tools and procedures for survey planning, data collection, data processing, analysis and reporting, and is supported by UNICEF headquarters for quality assurance and oversight. The standardised methodology of MICS, based on sound statistical and methodological principles, makes it one of the most valuable sources of development indicators for international comparison and trend analysis. With 365 surveys conducted in 121 different countries it has evolved into the largest source of statistics on children and women worldwide. This data has been instrumental in developing and monitoring a wide variety of policies and strategies, enabling governments and organizations to design effective interventions in areas such as health, education, child protection, nutrition, gender equality, water and sanitation, and living standards. The indicators that can be produced by the MICS and the background information collected on persons and households allow for extensive cross-tabulations and advanced analysis.

In this sense, the potential of the survey goes far beyond the capability of administrative sources and any statistical sources available for the seven years preceding the MICS 2025. Furthermore, the quality of MICS data implies that the survey is a valuable source for validating administrative records and census results. Structure of the MICS7 questionnaire The seventh round of the surveys - MICS7 - added new components and relaxed the survey regulations to better customise the instrument to the specific country needs. The MICS7 instrument provides standard questionnaires that can be used as a starting point for customisation by each country. It consists of five questionnaires targeting different universes: households, women aged 15-49, men aged 15-49, children aged 5-17 and children under age five. These questionnaires are divided into 86 modules and sub-modules focusing on specific topics relevant to the different universes that potentially can be included in the survey.

Some of these modules are necessary for identification purposes and analysis that is considered essential in MICS such as disaggregation of data by age, gender, education, ethnicity, wealth and disability status. Another 53 modules refer to ‘complementary topics’ that can be added based on survey scope, objectives, priorities, content constraints, funding availability and other concerns. While the base topics are generally considered important for survey purposes, there is also flexibility to omit certain modules if they are deemed redundant in a specific country. This flexible questionnaire architecture enables survey customisation to meet the needs of different countries. Annex I presents the MICS7 questionnaires and modules. Each of the questionnaire modules consists of a series of coherent questions that can produce one or more specific indicators relevant to the topic module. If certain modules are omitted, some questions can be transferred to the included modules. Methodological approach Exercise Timeline and Steps The MICS data gap assessment exercise was led by INSTAT.

In July - August 2023, INSTAT approached the Minister of Health and Social Protection, the Minister of Education and Sport, and the Minister of State for Youth and Children to explain the aim of the assessment. Time was required from these ministries to identify the technical staff or specialists who would engage in this exercise. The same orientation was provided to the UN-INSTAT data group. From September to December 2023, the first round of meetings was held to explain the specific methodology and the information required from the technical groups appointed by the aforementioned stakeholders as input for the data gap assessment. This involved a two-step approach, where stakeholders were first asked to identify the MICS questionnaire modules that cover the policy areas of their respective organizations. Upon receiving this information, stakeholders were provided with a list of indicators that could be produced by the selected modules, and they were asked to rate the relevance of these indicators from their organization’s perspective.

Assessment methodology Modules and indicators selection The methodology for the data gap assessment focuses on providing information to guide decisions about inclusion or exclusion of respective modules in the Albania MICS 2025 rather than that of the individual indicators. The rationale for focussing on the level of modules is that each module consists of a series of coherent questions that together produce one or more indicators. For practical reasons, it is usually not feasible to extract specific questions from a module to target individual indicators. Therefore, the content of the Albania MICS 2025 will depend on the decision for each module to be included it in its entirety or excluded altogether. The decision to include a module depends on its importance in filling existing information gaps. This importance, in turn, is based on the importance of the indicator(s) that the module can produce for addressing these gaps. For this reason, the data gap assessment methodology was designed to provide a ranking of modules based on the assessed importance of the indicators they produce.

In total, 39 modules are considered in this assessment. Information gap dimensions and measurement An information gap is not simply defined by the presence or absence of information. The methodology to rank the importance of the MICS indicators (and hence the importance of the modules) rests on the assessment of three dimensions: Relevance - the country-specific relevance of the indicator information (irrespective of the availability of the information) Recency - the availability and the recency of existing alternative sources - e.g. administrative data, surveys, censuses - that can produce the indicator information. Annex II provides an overview of survey and census sources that have been considered in this assessment.

Three sources provided input for rating the relevance dimension: the involved line ministries and their subordinate institutions, the UN agencies, and the consultants themselves. Each of the sources used a three-tier scoring system (Low relevance, Medium relevance, and High relevance, quantified as relevance scores of 1, 3, and 5, respectively) to assess the relevance of indicators that can be produced by the modules related to their fields of expertise.

It took Albania 17 years to move from 7% to 14% for the population over 65 years old, and only 7 years from 14% to 20%. And it is projected to go to almost 40% within 6 years.

Currently, only 1.6 percent of the elderly in need of care receive social care services. The residential care institutions can admit only 0.78 percent of the estimated number of the elderly in need of long-term care, and community care can be offered to only 1.8 percent of the estimated number of the elderly in need of long-term care. There is very little support mechanism for home care services.

Definition of Human Capital One of the founders of the concept of human capital, the Nobel winning scholar Gary Becker, considers human capital to be “the knowledge, information, ideas, skills, and health of individuals”2 (Becker [2002]. This definition takes a wider approach to human capital compared to what, e.g., the OECD3 proposes, focusing more its economic dimension when defining human capital as “the knowledge, skills, competencies and other attributes embodied in individuals that are relevant to economic activity”. In each case, human capital is considered to be a fundamental factor for economic prosperity.",199,True,False,True,False,0.0

In each case, human capital is considered to be a fundamental factor for economic prosperity. The World Bank in its 2017’s Human Capital Project uses a more complete definition of Human Capital, which is widely and commonly understood and agreed by development partners and many countries at all income levels: “Human capital consists of the knowledge, skills, and health that people accumulate throughout their lives, enabling them to realize their potential as productive members of society”4. Building on this foundation, Nobel Prize winner Theodore W. Schultz's seminal work provides additional depth to our understanding by identifying five key categories of human investment activities: (1) health facilities and services, (2) on-the-job training, (3) formal education, (4) adult study programs, and (5) migration to change job prospects. This framework emphasizes that people invest in themselves not for immediate consumption but with expectation of future gain, and such improvements amount to investment capital. Based on this work, Kevin McNamara describes human capital stocks to represent the existing skills and knowledge base of a workforce that supports a community's economic structure, while human capital flows refer to the rate at which new skills and knowledge are being added to this existing foundation through ongoing investments and development activities.",246,True,False,True,False,0.0

Thus, the concept of human capital emphasizes, at minimum, sustained investments in health, education, and the social protection of individuals, which align directly with protection from poverty (SDG1), quality education (SDG 4), good health and well-being (SDG 3), and decent work and economic growth (SDG 8).

For instance, the transition towards better educational systems is crucial. Enhanced education systems capable to deliver high-quality education for all children, starting from the early years, empower individuals with the skills, knowledge and dispositions necessary to successfully learn, innovate and adapt, which are critical for transitions in other areas such as digital connectivity and jobs and social protection.

Therefore, fostering human capital supports broader systemic changes required for sustainable development.

After an increase in 2020, poverty is estimated to have resumed its decline, driven by strong post-pandemic recovery. Income-based poverty ($6.85 PPP per day) declined from 41.6 percent in 2016 to 32.3 percent in 2019, as GDP per capita grew on average at 2.5 percent per year. After increasing to 34.3 percent in 2020 due to the November 2019 earthquake and the COVID-19 pandemic, poverty is estimated to have fallen to 21.7 percent in 2023 thanks to strong growth in GDP per capita, and it is projected to fall further by 1.5 percentage points in 2024. While inequality has fallen, it remains high, with a Gini index of equivalized income reaching 36 points in 2018, the highest in the Western Balkans after Montenegro (36.9). Poverty reduction is expected to continue, with a projected decline of 1.5 percentage points in 2024, from 21.7 percent in 2023. Vulnerability to economic shocks remains a concern. In 2022, substantial price increases, particularly in food and energy, eroded the purchasing power of the poorest households, who allocate a larger portion of their income to these essentials. The Prosperity Gap measure, which evaluates the distance between people’s incomes and a global prosperity standard of $25 per person per day, underscores the challenges of fostering inclusive growth.",232,True,False,True,False,0.0

The Prosperity Gap measure, which evaluates the distance between people’s incomes and a global prosperity standard of $25 per person per day, underscores the challenges of fostering inclusive growth. In 2023, Albania’s Prosperity Gap was 2.1, equal to the Western Balkans average, indicating that incomes would need to more than double on average to meet this prosperity standard. While the labor force participation rate has remained high throughout 2023, only 61 percent of women 15 to 64 years old were employed in Q3 2023. Albania possesses an untapped human capital potential that could drive growth and development. The country faces challenges, such as migration, economic inactivity, and underutilization of existing talent pools. Closing gender gaps in employment alone could lead to a significant 12 percent increase in long-term GDP per capita, highlighting the economic importance of women’s participation in the workforce. Addressing the underutilization of educated individuals becomes imperative not just for the immediate economic gains through increased productivity but also to maximize the returns on the educational investments that the country has made, ensuring sustainable growth. Promoting women’s economic participation is crucial for Albania’s trajectory to high-income status. Actively engaging, nurturing, and optimizing the diverse talents and capabilities of the population, especially of inactive segments, is paramount to underpinning this growth trajectory.",242,True,False,True,False,0.0

The database is managed and harmonized by the Europe and Central Asia Team for Statistical Development (ECATSD). ECAPOV includes 29 countries, with an average of 8 surveys per country. Recently, EU-SILC data for EU countries, received from Eurostat, have been added to the collection. Each survey in ECAPOV is organized into 6 modules following the Global Monitoring Database (GMD) harmonization guidelines, including the construction of the welfare aggregate which is used for Global Poverty Monitoring.

Political environment Domestic perspective Local Elections held in 2023 are the major political event that has occurred since the adoption of UNICEF Country Programme Document 2022 - 2026. The governing majority has remained unperturbed in the last decade, despite numerous indictments and arrests of key politicians among its own ranks, the restructurings of government and in light of a poorly functioning Parliament. The Socialist Party led by Prime Minister Edi Rama is governing for a third mandate 2013 - 2025, with a comfortable majority in parliament (77 mandates out of 140). While substitution of Ministers has been routine over the last 11 years in power, the reshuffling of the Government has been less frequent. The Government structure was changed after the March 2021 general elections to include, among other a Minister of State for Youth and Children. The structure of the government was reshuffled again in September 2023 to create a Ministry of Economy, Culture and Innovation and a Minister of State for Local Government.",247,True,False,True,False,0.0

The latest unannounced substitution of Ministers in the Government happened on July 28th 2024 concerning Ministers of Interior, Defense and of Finance. Parliament’s oversight of the executive remained limited1. This has continued to negatively affect the Parliament’s key functions of holding the executive accountable through effective scrutiny and of serving as a forum for constructive political debate, as well as its responsibility to elect in a timely manner the heads of key independent institutions. Currently, the Parliament is having difficulties in fulfilling its duty to elect the Ombudsperson. Parliament is still to elect a new Anti-Discrimination Commissioner. Delays and the politicization of these appointment processes weaken these independent institutions, and their interaction with UNICEF. Lack of executive accountability presents difficulties/(impairs) for UNICEF’s advocacy and outreach efforts and addressing the challenges related to fulfillment of its normative mandate.

Political polarization remains a notable feature of the Albanian political scene, with divisions within the opposition persisting. In late July 2024, both the governing Socialist Party (SP) and the main opposition Democratic Party (DP) passed amendments to the Electoral Code. As the May 2025 general elections approach, political tensions may increase. Polls and analysis2 suggest the possibility of the Socialist Party maintaining its position comfortably. A key driver with regard to institutional shaping of social protection, and early education is the Decentralization reform - it is likely to continue and deepen further. Local elections held in May 2023 confirmed the domination of the Socialist Party in the political landscape; the SP took 53 municipalities out of 61 municipalities in total. Some 40 electoral subjects registered, fielding a total of 144 mayoral candidates. Legal provisions require that half of the candidates for municipal councils should be women, however this was fully respected in only 10% of municipalities, indicating a poor culture of law enforcement and gender equity. The participation of young people was particularly low: among 122,545 first-time voters, only 16,628 (13%) cast a vote.

Moreover, children are at the heart of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which serve as a blueprint for achieving inclusive economic, social, and environmental progress. The realization of child rights and the SDGs are inextricably linked and mutually reinforcing: the CRC outlines the rights that governments must respect, protect, and fulfil for all children, while the SDGs provide a universal, time-bound framework to end poverty, protect the planet, and promote peace and prosperity for all. (UNICEF, 2020) To support the Government of Albania’s efforts to realize children’s rights and achieve the SDGs, UNICEF, in collaboration with the Ministry of Finance and Economy, initiated an analysis of public spending on children.

Such collaboration will be essential to ensure the instrument is robust, inclusive, and capable of advancing policies that protect and promote the rights of all children in Albania. Why measure public expenditure on children? a) To increase the effectiveness of policies for children Enhancing the visibility of children in public budgets is crucial to improving the effectiveness of policies and programs that promote children’s rights and well-being. Greater awareness of the importance of investing in children can influence decision-making and resource allocation, thereby elevating the priority afforded to childhood in public policies. The situation of children in Albania underscores the urgent need for increased and improved public spending on children. With a population of 2.8 million, of which approximately 23% (640,000) are children under the age of 18, children remain the most vulnerable age group in the country. In 2021, 28.5% of children were at risk of poverty, compared to 21.8% of adults aged 18-64 (EU SILC 2021). Income inequality and disparities in access to services and education persist as strategic challenges, limiting equity and opportunity for Albanian children.",243,True,True,True,False,0.0

Child Responsive Public Finance Developing Budget Markers for Child Allocations in Albania 7 Many European countries have introduced child-specific benefit systems, which have proven effective in reducing child poverty, improving family living standards, and enhancing child well- being. Albania is encouraged to explore the adoption of similar systems to support families with children. Increasing and improving the performance of public spending on children and adolescents also facilitates better evaluation of the impact of public expenditures and helps identify bottlenecks and barriers. This promotes efficiency and effectiveness in public spending. Public expenditure on basic social services such as education, healthcare, housing, and infrastructure are key indicators of social development, underscoring the rationale for prioritizing child- responsive budgeting. Investments in early childhood, when brain development is most rapid, have the greatest impact on cognitive and non-cognitive skills, forming the foundation for later achievements and determining the productivity of future investments in children and young adults. Equitable investment in all children fosters a more inclusive society and enhances the potential of tomorrow’s adults to contribute to Albania’s development. b) To strengthen implementation of public financial management principles towards child rights commitments Child-responsive budgeting is a vital mechanism to ensure accountability in translating commitments related to children into public budgets.",247,True,True,True,False,0.0

Results-based budgeting can align strategic planning with public finance management processes by directly linking strategic objectives to public spending. Additionally, child budget analysis enhances our understanding of the varying needs of children, youth, and adults, as well as the distributional effects and impacts of budget resources on these groups. This analysis provides a foundation for more effective and inclusive resource allocation, helping to address real needs, bridge gaps, and reduce inequalities. Furthermore, tracking public expenditure on children can significantly improve transparency and participation in budget processes. By monitoring the government’s financial efforts to support children, it fosters accountability and systematizes reporting on spending related to child rights. This is particularly critical in fulfilling obligations under Article 4 of the CRC, which calls for governments to allocate resources to the maximum extent possible to uphold children’s rights. Conducting the Child Budget Tagging Exercise Child budget tagging is a government-led process for identifying, measuring, and monitoring public expenditures relevant to children.

However, demographic change has influenced differences in regional development, pres­ suring the government to draw up new socio-economic policies to prevent greater inequality between the regions. Internal migration from urban zones to the country’s centre has significantly affected its development, transforming the Durrës and Tiranë area into an economic powerhouse while, at the same time, other regions face socio-economic challenges. Our continuing study from which this article presents some very early analysis aims to explore sustainable regional development in Albania using a comparative analysis of the regions of ‘Durana’ and Kukës. It concludes that Albania’s regional development has positively affect­ ed the urbanisation process but, in a negative way, rural depopulation. Both have influenced the structural deficiencies of ‘shrinking’ regions such as Kukës. Further research should define policies which establish a path towards sustainable devel­ opment in Albania in the future. Keywords: internal migration, demography, socio-economic development, re­ gional development Introduction Since 1990, Albania has implemented many economic and structural reforms despite domestic and regional instability.

According to the data reported in INSTAT’s 2021 Statistical Book, income per capita in Albania has increased steadily. However, the country remains one of the poorest in Europe, with high inequality between rural and urban zones and different regions. Thus, the role of Albanian regional governments in articulating and implement- ing new regional initiatives has been particularly critical ever since the 2000s. The new role of local governments was defined by the Law on Local Government, the Strategy of Decentralisation and Local Autonomy, the National Strategy of Social and Economic Development (NSSED) and other sectoral strategies. In this respect, local government responsibilities have gone far beyond service provision, aiming to formulate and implement short and long-term local economic development programmes. Furthermore, the approval of a fundamental legal package on fiscal de- centralisation at the end of 2002 led to the transfer of a series of taxes to the regions, shifting the balance between the state and the local provision of services.",220,True,False,True,True,0.0

This new legal framework offered the prospect of substantial fiscal autonomy for the regions by creating the necessary room for increasing local budgets and financing policies, thus leading to the development of municipalities, communes and regions (UNDP 2005). Another essential step in this respect was the regional development cross-cutting strategy, created at the end of 2008, even though its implementation remained prob- lematic (UNDP 2010). The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Energy was responsible for realising this strategy whose main aim was to facilitate the establishment of a single regional development planning and management system in the country.

Albania’s central and coastal zones have experienced a major increase in the population due to internal migration: INSTAT data show that the immigrant population in these centre and coastal zones was 44 times higher for the period between 1989-2001 compared to the north-east region and, in the same period, 13 times higher than in the south-east. Internal migration and the urbanisation process that Albania experienced in the post-communist years were driven by some direct factors including economic, polit- ical, social and cultural ones (Balla and Avdia 2022). The initial consequences of these demographic movements affected the Albanian labour market, with a shrinking labour pool in some regions, with most workers with better qualifications leaving the north-east region, including the prefecture of Kukës. The result was a negative impact on economic activity, employment and incomes in Kukës.

The last section draws some of the main conclusions. Theoretical perspective: sustainable development and regional development The concept of ‘sustainable development’ was first explained as a normative goal by the World Commission on Environment and Development in its 1987 report Our Common Future, presented to the General Assembly of the United Nations (World Anisa Balla, Flora Merko, Ela Golemi and Marta Biancardi 112 SEER Journal for Labour and Social Affairs in Eastern Europe 1/2023 https://doi.org/10.5771/1435-2869-2023-1-111, am 27.05.2025, 22:30:50 Open Access - - https://www.nomos-elibrary.de/de/agb Commission on Environment and Development 1987). According to the definition given by the Commission, sustainable development means: Meet[ing] the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. (World Commission on Environment and Development 1987: I para. 27) Sustainable development covers a complex range of ideas and meanings, gen- erally consisting of three lines: economic growth; environmental protection; and social progress (United Nations 1954).

However, despite all the attention devoted to explaining the concept, the perception of its core message has remained ambiguous and this therefore has proven a starting point for the attention of a welter of further studies. Meanwhile, referring to the broad sweep of the theoretical literature that we drew up for the study, the term ‘regional development’ is mainly used in the context of sustainable development to analyse case studies at a local or single ecosystem level of analysis. In contrast, sustainable development mainly refers to a spatial dimension. The importance of the spatial element arises from two main reasons: (1) local processes have global impacts; and (2) global trends give rise to local effects. Furthermore, environmental processes do not have the same uniform and smooth impact on all regions but may have different, yet significant, consequences on a regional scale (De Graaf et al. 1999). Neoclassical economics became one of the essential bases for regional develop- ment policies as it was applied mainly to the analysis of regional imbalances and how such problems might be solved. While classical economists were concerned with exploring the formation, distribution and utilisation of national surplus, the neoclassicists focused chiefly on the resource problem (Richardson 1973). An essen- tial condition for attaining so-called ‘interregional equilibrium’ is the integration of national territory (Hirschman 1958).",246,True,False,True,True,0.0

An essen- tial condition for attaining so-called ‘interregional equilibrium’ is the integration of national territory (Hirschman 1958). This can be achieved through improvements in national transport and communications networks, more widespread promotion of mobility and integration of the factors of production and commodities into national and international markets. In other words, the theoretical position of neoclassical economics rests upon the assumption that market forces ensure an ‘equilibrium’ in the spatial distribution of economic activity and everything else. Therefore, in order to reduce the regional gaps, neoclassical economic theory suggests a broad strategy involving the acceleration of growth in the leading regions and encouraging the migration of the unemployed and low-productivity labour from lagging regions to ‘booming’ ones (Perroux 1988).

However, if the income distribution is skewed and poor parts of the population are getting poorer, even while average income is increasing, many people - including economists - would be hesitant to call this development (Hicks 1965). The United Nations Research Institute for Social Development defined development as processes that increase people’s opportunity of choice (UNRISD 1972). Other researchers have highlighted education and health in a given society as essential factors for meeting basic needs. Education creates knowledge, skills and abilities, allowing more individual choice and freedom and, as such, is an essential part of development (Jorgenson and Fraumeni 1992). Finally, institutional arrangements and governance play an important role in individual free- dom and choice and are, according to some, essential parameters by which the level of development should be judged (De Macedo 2006). All these ideas have a focus on making humans better off, in one way or another, constituting well-being. One of the leading indicators used to measure quality of life is the Human Development Index (HDI). The HDI is a measure of human development; that is, of a country’s statistics in three dimensions: longevity and health; education; and GNI per capita. This index was developed within the UN Development Program and published in 1990 in the Human Development Report of the United Nations.",238,True,False,True,True,0.0

This index was developed within the UN Development Program and published in 1990 in the Human Development Report of the United Nations. The main reason for introducing a new measurement index was to take attention away from income towards a broader measure of human development: Past efforts to devise such an index have not come up with a fully satisfactory measure... They have focussed either on income or on social indicators, without bringing them together in a composite index. Since human beings are both the means and the end of development, a composite index must capture both these aspects. This Report... suggest[s] an index that captures the three essential components of human life - longevity, knowledge and basic income for a decent living standard. Longevity and knowledge refer to the formation of human capabilities, and income is a proxy measure for the choices people have in putting their capabilities to use. (UNDP 1990: 14) In the 2010 Human Development Report, UNDP began using a new method to measure HDI by combining these three dimensions: a long and healthy life (life expectancy at birth); knowledge and education (expected years of schooling and average years of schooling); and a good standard of living (Gross National Income (GNI) per capita). According to the old method, the HDI is based on the arithmetic mean of these three indexes.",249,True,False,True,False,0.0

This updated reporting format focuses on the Strategy as a whole, particularly on the new priorities as formulated for the first phase (2021-2025) of the next implementation period from 2021 to 2030, and is based on the frame and procedure agreed in the first phase of the review of implementation of the Strategy. The reporting format also takes into account the previous reporting exercises in 2010, 2014 and 2018, the related reporting templates (ECE/CEP/AC.13/2009/10, annex, ECE/CEP/AC.13/2014/5, annex, and ECE/CEP/AC.13/2018/4, annex I, respectively) and the feedback from countries following those exercises on the workability and feasibility of the indicators and the requested information for reporting. 2.

In 2014, to reflect the requirements of the third phase (2011-2015) of the Strategy’s initial implementation period (2005-2015), in consultation with the Expert Group on Indicators, the secretariat introduced a few changes to the reporting template developed by the Group.2 4. In 2018, to reflect the requirements and priorities of the 2017-2019 implementation phase - as outlined in the framework for the future implementation of the Strategy (ECE/BATUMI.CONF/2016/11) - in consultation with the Bureau, the secretariat introduced some additional changes to the 2014 reporting template developed by the Expert Group.3 5.

This updated reporting format focuses on the Strategy as a whole, particularly on the new priorities as formulated for the first phase (2021-2025) of the next implementation period from 2021 to 2030, and is based on the frame and procedure agreed in the first phase of the review of implementation of the Strategy. The reporting format also takes into account the previous reporting exercises in 2010, 2014 and 2018, the related reporting templates (ECE/CEP/AC.13/2009/10, annex, ECE/CEP/AC.13/2014/5, annex, and ECE/CEP/AC.13/2018/4, annex I, respectively) and the feedback from countries following those exercises on the workability and feasibility of the indicators and the requested information for reporting. 2.

In 2014, to reflect the requirements of the third phase (2011-2015) of the Strategy’s initial implementation period (2005-2015), in consultation with the Expert Group on Indicators, the secretariat introduced a few changes to the reporting template developed by the Group.2 4. In 2018, to reflect the requirements and priorities of the 2017-2019 implementation phase - as outlined in the framework for the future implementation of the Strategy (ECE/BATUMI.CONF/2016/11) - in consultation with the Bureau, the secretariat introduced some additional changes to the 2014 reporting template developed by the Expert Group.3 5.

The Action Plan 2021-2025, went through a comprehensive consultation process with the participation of key actors, state administration institutions at the central level, independent institutions, international organizations and partners, civil society, etc. The vision of the Cross-cutting Justice Strategy 2021-2025 is: ""An independent, accountable, accessible, transparent and efficient justice system that safeguards human rights and serves society according to European standards.""",234,True,False,True,False,0.0

However, demographic change has influenced differences in regional development, pres­ suring the government to draw up new socio-economic policies to prevent greater inequality between the regions. Internal migration from urban zones to the country’s centre has significantly affected its development, transforming the Durrës and Tiranë area into an economic powerhouse while, at the same time, other regions face socio-economic challenges. Our continuing study from which this article presents some very early analysis aims to explore sustainable regional development in Albania using a comparative analysis of the regions of ‘Durana’ and Kukës. It concludes that Albania’s regional development has positively affect­ ed the urbanisation process but, in a negative way, rural depopulation. Both have influenced the structural deficiencies of ‘shrinking’ regions such as Kukës. Further research should define policies which establish a path towards sustainable devel­ opment in Albania in the future.

According to the data reported in INSTAT’s 2021 Statistical Book, income per capita in Albania has increased steadily. However, the country remains one of the poorest in Europe, with high inequality between rural and urban zones and different regions. Thus, the role of Albanian regional governments in articulating and implement- ing new regional initiatives has been particularly critical ever since the 2000s. The new role of local governments was defined by the Law on Local Government, the Strategy of Decentralisation and Local Autonomy, the National Strategy of Social and Economic Development (NSSED) and other sectoral strategies. In this respect, local government responsibilities have gone far beyond service provision, aiming to formulate and implement short and long-term local economic development programmes. Furthermore, the approval of a fundamental legal package on fiscal de- centralisation at the end of 2002 led to the transfer of a series of taxes to the regions, shifting the balance between the state and the local provision of services.",220,True,False,True,True,0.0

This new legal framework offered the prospect of substantial fiscal autonomy for the regions by creating the necessary room for increasing local budgets and financing policies, thus leading to the development of municipalities, communes and regions (UNDP 2005). Another essential step in this respect was the regional development cross-cutting strategy, created at the end of 2008, even though its implementation remained prob- lematic (UNDP 2010).

Albania’s central and coastal zones have experienced a major increase in the population due to internal migration: INSTAT data show that the immigrant population in these centre and coastal zones was 44 times higher for the period between 1989-2001 compared to the north-east region and, in the same period, 13 times higher than in the south-east. Internal migration and the urbanisation process that Albania experienced in the post-communist years were driven by some direct factors including economic, polit- ical, social and cultural ones (Balla and Avdia 2022). The initial consequences of these demographic movements affected the Albanian labour market, with a shrinking labour pool in some regions, with most workers with better qualifications leaving the north-east region, including the prefecture of Kukës. The result was a negative impact on economic activity, employment and incomes in Kukës.

The last section draws some of the main conclusions. Theoretical perspective: sustainable development and regional development The concept of ‘sustainable development’ was first explained as a normative goal by the World Commission on Environment and Development in its 1987 report Our Common Future, presented to the General Assembly of the United Nations (World Anisa Balla, Flora Merko, Ela Golemi and Marta Biancardi 112 SEER Journal for Labour and Social Affairs in Eastern Europe 1/2023 https://doi.org/10.5771/1435-2869-2023-1-111, am 27.05.2025, 22:30:50 Open Access - - https://www.nomos-elibrary.de/de/agb Commission on Environment and Development 1987). According to the definition given by the Commission, sustainable development means: Meet[ing] the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. (World Commission on Environment and Development 1987: I para. 27) Sustainable development covers a complex range of ideas and meanings, gen- erally consisting of three lines: economic growth; environmental protection; and social progress (United Nations 1954).

However, despite all the attention devoted to explaining the concept, the perception of its core message has remained ambiguous and this therefore has proven a starting point for the attention of a welter of further studies. Meanwhile, referring to the broad sweep of the theoretical literature that we drew up for the study, the term ‘regional development’ is mainly used in the context of sustainable development to analyse case studies at a local or single ecosystem level of analysis. In contrast, sustainable development mainly refers to a spatial dimension. The importance of the spatial element arises from two main reasons: (1) local processes have global impacts; and (2) global trends give rise to local effects. Furthermore, environmental processes do not have the same uniform and smooth impact on all regions but may have different, yet significant, consequences on a regional scale (De Graaf et al. 1999). Neoclassical economics became one of the essential bases for regional develop- ment policies as it was applied mainly to the analysis of regional imbalances and how such problems might be solved. While classical economists were concerned with exploring the formation, distribution and utilisation of national surplus, the neoclassicists focused chiefly on the resource problem (Richardson 1973). An essen- tial condition for attaining so-called ‘interregional equilibrium’ is the integration of national territory (Hirschman 1958).",246,True,False,True,True,0.0

An essen- tial condition for attaining so-called ‘interregional equilibrium’ is the integration of national territory (Hirschman 1958). This can be achieved through improvements in national transport and communications networks, more widespread promotion of mobility and integration of the factors of production and commodities into national and international markets. In other words, the theoretical position of neoclassical economics rests upon the assumption that market forces ensure an ‘equilibrium’ in the spatial distribution of economic activity and everything else. Therefore, in order to reduce the regional gaps, neoclassical economic theory suggests a broad strategy involving the acceleration of growth in the leading regions and encouraging the migration of the unemployed and low-productivity labour from lagging regions to ‘booming’ ones (Perroux 1988).

However, if the income distribution is skewed and poor parts of the population are getting poorer, even while average income is increasing, many people - including economists - would be hesitant to call this development (Hicks 1965). The United Nations Research Institute for Social Development defined development as processes that increase people’s opportunity of choice (UNRISD 1972). Other researchers have highlighted education and health in a given society as essential factors for meeting basic needs. Education creates knowledge, skills and abilities, allowing more individual choice and freedom and, as such, is an essential part of development (Jorgenson and Fraumeni 1992). Finally, institutional arrangements and governance play an important role in individual free- dom and choice and are, according to some, essential parameters by which the level of development should be judged (De Macedo 2006). All these ideas have a focus on making humans better off, in one way or another, constituting well-being. One of the leading indicators used to measure quality of life is the Human Development Index (HDI). The HDI is a measure of human development; that is, of a country’s statistics in three dimensions: longevity and health; education; and GNI per capita. This index was developed within the UN Development Program and published in 1990 in the Human Development Report of the United Nations.",238,True,False,True,True,0.0

This index was developed within the UN Development Program and published in 1990 in the Human Development Report of the United Nations. The main reason for introducing a new measurement index was to take attention away from income towards a broader measure of human development: Past efforts to devise such an index have not come up with a fully satisfactory measure... They have focussed either on income or on social indicators, without bringing them together in a composite index. Since human beings are both the means and the end of development, a composite index must capture both these aspects. This Report... suggest[s] an index that captures the three essential components of human life - longevity, knowledge and basic income for a decent living standard. Longevity and knowledge refer to the formation of human capabilities, and income is a proxy measure for the choices people have in putting their capabilities to use. (UNDP 1990: 14) In the 2010 Human Development Report, UNDP began using a new method to measure HDI by combining these three dimensions: a long and healthy life (life expectancy at birth); knowledge and education (expected years of schooling and average years of schooling); and a good standard of living (Gross National Income (GNI) per capita).

Their combined efforts have been essential to achieving these successes. Significant achievements include two transformative joint programmes financed by the Sustainable Development Goal Fund: Digital Agriculture and Rural Transformation (DART) and Lifelong Empowerment and Protection in Albania. Meanwhile, the country’s first National SDG Roadmap was successfully created, with other initiatives such as the Women Entrepreneurship Expo aiming to foster an inclusive business environment, with six companies joining the UN Global Compact and 38 pledging support for the Women’s Empowerment Principles. Our support for building the country’s human capital focuses on effectively implementing reforms in social care, education and healthcare. Albania’s participation in the Global Accelerator on Jobs and Social Protection for Just Transition underscores its commitment to advancing labour policies, social welfare and inclusive measures for vulnerable groups. Adoption of the Social Protection Strategy (2024-2030) and the Social Inclusion Policy (2024-2028) lays the foundation for enhanced services and the inclusion of vulnerable groups of the population. Repair and reconstruction of 66 education facilities damaged by the 2019 earthquake benefited more than 24,000 students, and training was provided for more than 1,300 teachers in inclusive education and digital learning.

Investments include the establishment of 47 IT labs, 107 science laboratories, 56 psychological- nursery rooms and 66 sports fields and gyms. Primary healthcare advancement, emergency preparedness and effective public +health management are central to Albania’s health strategy. A transparency portal and a GIS platform aim to improve planning and address infrastructure needs, while vaccination, child nutrition monitoring and emergency preparedness have been improved. Green growth and efforts to combat climate change have driven progress in climate-smart agriculture, vocational education and digital transformation. Employment and skills development initiatives reached thousands of individuals, while work on the green and blue economies saw gender integration in tourism, and the revitalization of Albania’s cultural heritage, with 18 cultural sites benefiting from restoration and upgraded facilities. Implementation of the groundbreaking DART aims to leverage digitalization to advance sustainability goals with systemic interventions aimed particularly at smallholder farmers. The country also advanced in fulfilling its commitments under the Montreal Protocol by implementing systems to phase out ozone-depleting substances and adopting low- global-warming technologies. Albania made progress in governance and human rights, underpinned by key policy changes and strategic interventions.

Ongoing investments in legal aid, judicial efficiency and a child- centred approach to justice are creating a more inclusive and responsive legal system. The implementation roadmap of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, and the National Migration Strategy 2024-2030, is supporting the alignment of national laws with international human rights standards. Additionally, the finalization of the Population and Housing Census 2023 is a significant achievement enabling detailed analysis of trends, disparities and needs across the population. Gender equality in Albania has been supported by a robust legal framework and improvements in key indices. The country has made notable progress in advancing gender equality and addressing violence against women and children. Support from the UN enhanced services for survivors of domestic violence, trafficking and other forms of abuse, providing both immediate assistance and long-term empowerment for women and children from vulnerable groups. Gender- responsive budgeting has become an integral part of Albania’s financial planning. As a result, 59 per cent of budgetary programmes for 2025 now incorporate gender-specific objectives, driving more equitable resource distribution and policy implementation. Additionally, efforts to strengthen national gender equality mechanisms are bolstered by legal reforms. We extend our deepest appreciation to all our partners for their invaluable contributions and look forward to continuing our collaboration in 2025, working together to build a more resilient, inclusive and sustainable Albania.",239,True,False,True,False,0.0

Despite demographic challenges, life expectancy has improved, reaching 78 years for men and 82 years for women in 2024. However, public expenditures on health and education remain limited (3% and 2.7% of GDP, respectively) and Albania’s purchasing power is one of the lowest in Europe (35% of the European Union (EU) average in 2023), reflecting the need for continued economic reforms and structural transformation.

Their combined efforts have been essential to achieving these successes. Significant achievements include two transformative joint programmes financed by the Sustainable Development Goal Fund: Digital Agriculture and Rural Transformation (DART) and Lifelong Empowerment and Protection in Albania. Meanwhile, the country’s first National SDG Roadmap was successfully created, with other initiatives such as the Women Entrepreneurship Expo aiming to foster an inclusive business environment, with six companies joining the UN Global Compact and 38 pledging support for the Women’s Empowerment Principles. Our support for building the country’s human capital focuses on effectively implementing reforms in social care, education and healthcare. Albania’s participation in the Global Accelerator on Jobs and Social Protection for Just Transition underscores its commitment to advancing labour policies, social welfare and inclusive measures for vulnerable groups. Adoption of the Social Protection Strategy (2024-2030) and the Social Inclusion Policy (2024-2028) lays the foundation for enhanced services and the inclusion of vulnerable groups of the population.

A transparency portal and a GIS platform aim to improve planning and address infrastructure needs, while vaccination, child nutrition monitoring and emergency preparedness have been improved. Green growth and efforts to combat climate change have driven progress in climate-smart agriculture, vocational education and digital transformation. Employment and skills development initiatives reached thousands of individuals, while work on the green and blue economies saw gender integration in tourism, and the revitalization of Albania’s cultural heritage, with 18 cultural sites benefiting from restoration and upgraded facilities. Implementation of the groundbreaking DART aims to leverage digitalization to advance sustainability goals with systemic interventions aimed particularly at smallholder farmers.

Support from the UN enhanced services for survivors of domestic violence, trafficking and other forms of abuse, providing both immediate assistance and long-term empowerment for women and children from vulnerable groups. Gender- responsive budgeting has become an integral part of Albania’s financial planning. As a result, 59 per cent of budgetary programmes for 2025 now incorporate gender-specific objectives, driving more equitable resource distribution and policy implementation.

Albania has made notable progress in promoting gender equality in political, economic, and public spheres, underpinned by legislative frameworks which include mandatory gender quotas in electoral processes and public administration. However, women continue to face structural, cultural, and institutional barriers that hinder their full and effective equal participation in leadership and decision-making. 3.4.1. Women in Parliament and Local Governance Women in Parliament. Albania has undertaken significant steps to enhance women's representation in national governance. The Electoral Code (2020) mandates a 30% gender quota for parliamentary elections, with the Central Election Commission (CEC) empowered to enforce compliance by sanctioning political parties that fail to meet this threshold. In addition, 30% gender quotas for all levels of the electoral administration were mandated and sanctions for non-compliance of the gender quota, replacing fines with list-rejection measures. This legal framework has contributed to an increase in women’s representation in the Albanian Assembly from 29.5% (36 women) in 2020 to 35.7% (50 women) in 2024.

In addition, a survey conducted in 2023 and published in 2024 from civil society8, highlighted that the increase in the number of women councilors does not necessarily mean that their influence in the municipality councils is increased. Findings from this survey show that based on the transcription of 49 municipal council meetings, it resulted that the councilors spoke 8,300 times. Men spoke 6,169 times (74.33%) and women spoke 2,131 times (25.67%). Women were interrupted more often, 453 times out of 2,131 times they spoke (21.26%); meanwhile, men were interrupted 524 times out of 6,169 times they spoke (8.49%).

In addition, the survey emphasized that even if women want to run for re-election, they often do not have the opportunity because party leaders decide to replace them, often regardless of their contribution to the community. Another reason for women’s dropout is their life experience of being often discredited or interrupted during public speeches.9 Women leave the municipality councils also because of pressure from party leaders. This phenomenon has not received attention so far. Political parties may respect the gender quota when submitting lists to the Central Election Commission, but after the elections, they pressure women to withdraw in masse to make space for men.10 One form of pressure is the threat of dismissal. In one of the municipality councils, more than ten women withdrew to make space for men.

The municipality of Tirana i.e., which has 27 Administrative Units and 3 Neighborhoods, has only 5 women Administrators (16%).13 Or in the municipality of Elbasan, i.e., from the total of 116 villages only 2 (1.7%) have women as Head of Villages.14 Similarly in other municipalities, data will show either the minimum or total absence of women in these leadership positions. A specific focus must be also on young women and their political participation. Beyond increasing representation, ensuring meaningful participation is essential, as young women continue to face gender stereotypes, limited mentorship opportunities, and underrepresentation in key political structures, especially in administrative units and villages.

Violence Against Women in Elections A study conducted in 2021 “Violence against women during the elections and gender bias in the media coverage of the April 2021 general elections in Albania”16 reveals that: While many media are operating in Albania, media owners usually exercise control over the content, limiting editorial independence and encouraging self-censorship among journalists, many of whom are precariously employed. In the past, the media have reported cases of violence against women during elections and violence against women in politics, for example, cases where women candidates have faced pressure to resign rather than take their seats as MPs, and physical attacks on women candidates during election rallies. Overall, however, the media often promote the delegitimization of women as viable political actors by portraying women in public life in a sexualized manner, reporting claims about their personal lives, or focusing on their clothes and appearance, rather than their work and essential contribution to society.",238,True,False,True,False,0.0

Quantitative monitoring revealed a very low media engagement on issues related to women’s rights and gender equality. Only 2% of election-related articles or broadcasts in the pre-election period, 1% in the election and post-election period, and 2% in the period covering the formation of the new cabinet of ministers included some discussions of sexual and reproductive rights, violence towards women, women’s economic, cultural or social rights, or women’s political participation.17",204,True,True,False,False,0.0

The project’s primary objective was to monitor a selected sample of print and online media, television channels and social media, aiming to identify various negative stereotypes used in the country. Following the monitoring process, the collected data were classified and visualised, and a glossary of stereotypical terms used by the media compiled.

These tools will help key societal actors to accept others by avoiding stereotypical and prejudicial thinking, a major cause of hate speech in the country’s media. They will also raise awareness among journalists, the public and political actors, indeed of the whole of society, of the harmful consequences of the use of stereotypical language in media that fosters, in turn, audience prejudice or hatred based on ethnicity, region of origin, gender, or social status. The study’s findings can also be integrated into the curricula for students of journalism and of social and political sciences. Such students may become familiar with and learn about the various types of stereotypes, methods for deconstructing them and how to avoid their use in their work and daily life.

In the present study, based on monitoring of the media, stereotypes were not considered as merely logical constructs but primarily acts of communication. Thus, within such a framework, they act as means of expression in mass communication and not merely as linguistic- logical terms. The semantics of stereotypes, the meaning of keywords and the formulaic sentences that contain them within their phraseological structure, such as stigmatising sentences, depend on the entire communicative universe: the tone, the extra-linguistic context in which they are expressed, their author and speaker, the dialect used, the accompanying images in audiovisual media, as well as many other situations. Without highlighting such elements, it is almost impossible to grasp the full meaning and function of the stereotyping process, and any understanding would be limited. Meanwhile, it is nearly impossible to model all forms of stereotyping and stigma in contemporary Albanian society. Such characterisations are diverse, affecting or carried by different social groups, and take place based on specific characteristics varying by social sphere, such as politics, family, economy, property and neighbourhood.",249,True,False,False,False,0.0

Thirdly, it was deemed reasonable to assess the risk of their use to social peace, the potential to infringe upon or violate citizens’ rights, and their equality before the law.

Although some stereotypes have existed in the past, even centuries ago, today they have a different content and are revitalised by completely different social, economic and political conditions from previously.

In the present monitoring, the priority was to identify, select, classify and critically deconstruct those that appear to be the most prevalent. a. Gender-Based Stereotypes: Primarily, these are stigmas that discriminate against women, considering them less capable in work and professional ability than men. This stereotype reflects a form of machismo directed against women. b. Stereotypes Related to Different Sexual Behaviours: Here, stereotyping and stigmatisation are accompanied even more than in other cases by discriminatory language and hate speech, leading to bullying of various individuals. c. Age-Related Stereotypes as a Form of Generational Conflict: This includes the political (but not only) use of age as a form of discrimination against elderly people. In the media, stigmas such as të rrjedhur, të currufjepsur, pleq (senile, decrepit, old folk) occasionally appear. d.

BACKGROUND INFORMATION The Republic of Albania ratified the 1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees and its 1967 Protocol through Presidential Decree 200 in June 1992, without geographical limitations or reservations. Albania is a State party to the 1954 Convention Relating to the Status of Stateless Persons and the 1961 Convention on the Reduction of Statelessness. Albania is also a party to the European Convention on Nationality. European Union integration is a national objective and a basis for various reforms in the country. The outcome of the Intergovernmental Conference at ministerial level in 2022 resulted in the EU opening accession negotiations with Albania. This was followed by the opening of the screening process, which indicated Albania’s level of alignment with EU legislation. Once the date for opening of the accession negotiations is set, this may further stimulate improvements in the asylum policy development and practice. Albania is a signatory to several key international and regional human rights instruments and has taken steps to strengthen its legal framework aimed at harmonising its legislative framework with EU acquis. Albania is considered primarily as a transit country by most refugees and migrants, and the authorities. Due to the general tendency of asylum-seekers to pursue onward movement, few asylum-seekers remain for extended periods in the country.",244,True,False,True,False,0.0

Due to the general tendency of asylum-seekers to pursue onward movement, few asylum-seekers remain for extended periods in the country. As of December 2023, 15 applications (affecting 26 persons in total) were pending asylum processing. The demographic structure of refugees and asylum-seekers residing in the country is as follows: 76 children (age bracket 0-17/ 32 girls; 44 boys); 73 adults (age bracket 18-49/ 35 women; 37 men); 12 older adults (age bracket 50-59/ 5 women; 7 men) and 11 elderly persons (above 60 years old/ 3 women; 8 men). The nationalities of the refugee and asylum- seeker population currently in the country are: Kosovo1, Afghanistan, Belarus, “Guantanamo caseload” (China/Uzbekistan), DR Congo, Egypt, Iraq, Montenegro, Palestine, Russia, Syria, Tunisia, and Venezuela. There are currently 30 persons who are residing in the Reception Centre for Asylum, with others reside in urban areas. Throughout 2023, Albania continued to see mixed movements of refugees and migrants, with 4,307 arrivals at the borders. This constitutes a 46% decrease from 2022. Despite the significant drop in figures, there was an increase of the number of persons referred to asylum processing compared to the same period in 2022 (4,5% increase). In 2023, a total of 282 persons were referred for asylum processing.

However, ongoing restrictions in access to the asylum procedure and other appropriate processes continue to be of concern to UNHCR. Since 2018, Albania has not granted refugee status to any applicant. Those found to be in need of international protection have been exclusively granted subsidiary forms of protection. In 2022, Albania decided to grant refugees from Ukraine the right to enter and stay for up to one year without a residence permit, or to apply and obtain temporary protection. From 24 February 2022 to 31 December 2023, some 42,000 refugees from Ukraine entered Albania, of which 38,268 eventually left the country.

The new Law on Citizenship No 113 was approved in 2020. This law addresses some of the previous impediments and is aimed at resolving the civil status of persons at risk of statelessness and simplifying the process of naturalisation of foreign citizens including refugees. The Article 7(1) of the Law on Citizenship stipulates that “a child born or found in the territory of the Republic of Albania at risk of being stateless, is granted Albanian citizenship”.

KEY PROTECTION ISSUES, CHALLENGES AND RECOMMENDATIONS Challenges linked to outstanding 3rd cycle UPR recommendations Issue 1: Unaccompanied and separated children in need of international protection Linked to 3rd cycle UPR recommendations nos. 95.161-95.164 UNHCR and partners continued monitoring the pre-screening procedure, supporting identification and referral of persons in need of international protection or with specific needs, including unaccompanied and separated children (hereinafter UASC). Limited progress has been made in ensuring displaced children’s inclusion in the national child 3 protection system. In 2023, 48 identified UASC were intercepted by the Border and Migration police entering Albania and 32 of them were referred to the asylum process. None of the UASC started the process of lodging of their asylum applications, in part due to long and unclear division of competences and responsibilities between different state authorities in charge of child protection. Lack of interpreters and gaps in safeguards (including lack of appointments of legal guardians) have contributed to all UASC leaving the country before the asylum claims were filed. This puts UASC at heightened risk of vulnerability to violence and human trafficking. Additionally, the lack of separate reception facilities for UASC or designated areas within existing reception facilities remains a significant gap to assist vulnerable children.",228,True,False,True,False,0.0

Additionally, the lack of separate reception facilities for UASC or designated areas within existing reception facilities remains a significant gap to assist vulnerable children. Even though the Law No.18/2017 explicitly stipulates that any child on Albanian territory should be protected, the Law on Social Care Services limits service provision to those who reside in Albania and particularly to those who have not started the asylum procedures. As a result, asylum-seeking UASC, whether they have managed to lodge an asylum claim or not, are denied access. This is a major legal shortcoming which has not yet been addressed. On the job training and capacity building is needed for the asylum authorities (i.e., the Child Protection Unit, and social services professionals) to implement appropriate interviewing techniques and treatment of UASC, including for those that are not qualified and/or do not seek asylum. Best Interest Assessments (BIA) and Best Interest Determinations (BID) should be conducted by multi-sectoral teams mandated to conduct such exercises when a case of UASC is referred or brought to them by child protection workers. Upon joint UNHCR-UNICEF advocacy, the Parliament requested UN agencies for their proposals to improve legislation on protection of UASC.

Moreover, children are at the heart of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which serve as a blueprint for achieving inclusive economic, social, and environmental progress. The realization of child rights and the SDGs are inextricably linked and mutually reinforcing: the CRC outlines the rights that governments must respect, protect, and fulfil for all children, while the SDGs provide a universal, time-bound framework to end poverty, protect the planet, and promote peace and prosperity for all. (UNICEF, 2020) To support the Government of Albania’s efforts to realize children’s rights and achieve the SDGs, UNICEF, in collaboration with the Ministry of Finance and Economy, initiated an analysis of public spending on children. Using the Child-focused Public Expenditure Measurement (C-PEM) methodology-an innovative tool developed by UNICEF-this analysis informed policy recommendations to enhance the alignment of government budgets with commitments to children’s rights.

Such collaboration will be essential to ensure the instrument is robust, inclusive, and capable of advancing policies that protect and promote the rights of all children in Albania. Why measure public expenditure on children? a) To increase the effectiveness of policies for children Enhancing the visibility of children in public budgets is crucial to improving the effectiveness of policies and programs that promote children’s rights and well-being. Greater awareness of the importance of investing in children can influence decision-making and resource allocation, thereby elevating the priority afforded to childhood in public policies. The situation of children in Albania underscores the urgent need for increased and improved public spending on children. With a population of 2.8 million, of which approximately 23% (640,000) are children under the age of 18, children remain the most vulnerable age group in the country. In 2021, 28.5% of children were at risk of poverty, compared to 21.8% of adults aged 18-64 (EU SILC 2021). Income inequality and disparities in access to services and education persist as strategic challenges, limiting equity and opportunity for Albanian children.",243,True,True,True,False,0.0

Income inequality and disparities in access to services and education persist as strategic challenges, limiting equity and opportunity for Albanian children. Child Responsive Public Finance Developing Budget Markers for Child Allocations in Albania 7 Many European countries have introduced child-specific benefit systems, which have proven effective in reducing child poverty, improving family living standards, and enhancing child well- being. Albania is encouraged to explore the adoption of similar systems to support families with children. Increasing and improving the performance of public spending on children and adolescents also facilitates better evaluation of the impact of public expenditures and helps identify bottlenecks and barriers. This promotes efficiency and effectiveness in public spending. Public expenditure on basic social services such as education, healthcare, housing, and infrastructure are key indicators of social development, underscoring the rationale for prioritizing child- responsive budgeting. Investments in early childhood, when brain development is most rapid, have the greatest impact on cognitive and non-cognitive skills, forming the foundation for later achievements and determining the productivity of future investments in children and young adults. Equitable investment in all children fosters a more inclusive society and enhances the potential of tomorrow’s adults to contribute to Albania’s development. b) To strengthen implementation of public financial management principles towards child rights commitments Child-responsive budgeting is a vital mechanism to ensure accountability in translating commitments related to children into public budgets.",247,True,True,True,False,0.0

Results-based budgeting can align strategic planning with public finance management processes by directly linking strategic objectives to public spending. Additionally, child budget analysis enhances our understanding of the varying needs of children, youth, and adults, as well as the distributional effects and impacts of budget resources on these groups. This analysis provides a foundation for more effective and inclusive resource allocation, helping to address real needs, bridge gaps, and reduce inequalities. Furthermore, tracking public expenditure on children can significantly improve transparency and participation in budget processes. By monitoring the government’s financial efforts to support children, it fosters accountability and systematizes reporting on spending related to child rights. This is particularly critical in fulfilling obligations under Article 4 of the CRC, which calls for governments to allocate resources to the maximum extent possible to uphold children’s rights. Conducting the Child Budget Tagging Exercise Child budget tagging is a government-led process for identifying, measuring, and monitoring public expenditures relevant to children.

Clearance Rate (CR) is the ratio obtained by dividing the number of resolved cases by the number of incoming cases in a given period, expressed as a percentage. It demonstrates how the court or the judicial system is coping with the in-flow of cases and allows comparison between systems regardless of their differences and individual characteristics.

Disposition Time (DT) is the indicator that calculates time necessary for a pending case to be resolved and estimates the lengths of proceedings in days. It is a ratio between the pending cases at the end of the period and the resolved cases within the same period, multiplied by 365 days.

ICT Tools The Albanian judiciary currently uses two case management systems (CMS), CMIS and ARKIT, both of which are outdated and operate with local installations across different courts. Recognizing the need for a more modern and unified system, the Centre for IT in the Judiciary of Albania, following the High Judicial Council's proposal, adopted a roadmap in December 2021 to develop a new, state-of-the-art court case management system. This initiative aims to replace the existing disparate systems with a single, standardized solution that enhances efficiency, security, and management. Presently, the existing systems function offline and rely on individual courts for security and maintenance, highlighting the need for an integrated and centralized approach.

JUSTICE SYSTEM Albania has a three-tier justice system, including courts of general and specialised jurisdiction and a Constitutional Court1. Following the reorganisation of the judicial system in 20232, there are thirteen First Instance District Courts of general jurisdiction, and one Court of Appeal. The courts of specialised jurisdiction include two Administrative Courts and two Specialised Courts for Anti-Corruption and Organised Crime3. The High Court serves as a second and final instance court and ensures consistent interpretation and application of the law.

Albania has been implementing a substantial judicial reform since 2016, which resulted in the restructuring of the entire justice system. The ongoing judicial reform is based on two pillars. First, the institutional restructuring of the entire judiciary and prosecution, including the reform of the Constitutional Court and the establishment of new self-governing bodies of the judiciary.

The reform notably introduced a revised mechanism for the appointment of Constitutional Court judges, including through a ranking by an independent Justice Appointments Council (JAC). A de-blocking mechanism was also introduced, enabling the first-ranked candidate by the JAC to be appointed10, if the Parliament fails to agree on a candidate.

CONTEXT Following the first Intergovernmental Conference on accession negotiations on 19 July 2022, the screening sessions for all six clusters were completed on 24 November 2023. In the context of accession negotiations, Albania submitted the three roadmaps that will guide its reforms efforts. Albania continued to implement the Stabilisation and Association Agreement, and the joint bodies under the agreement met. An intergovernmental conference was convened in October 2024 to open accession negotiations on cluster 1 - fundamentals. The firm political commitment of the Albanian authorities to the strategic goal of European Union integration has been consistently stated as the country’s key priority, and a high level of ambition to move forward in the accession negotiations has been generally maintained. The ongoing accession negotiation process needs to lead to an acceleration of EU-related reforms. Albania maintained its record of full alignment with the EU’s common foreign and security policy. During its term as a non-permanent member of the UN Security Council between 2022 and 2023, Albania actively engaged as a co-penholder of resolutions condemning Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine, aligning with the EU position, including on restrictive measures and sanctions against Russia.

However, its oversight over the executive remains limited. Parliament’s activity was affected by continuous clashes between the ruling majority and a part of the opposition between October 2023 and March 2024. These reflected a lack of constructive and inclusive political dialogue and resulted in opposition MPs causing disruptions due to alleged restrictions on their rights. Despite the welcome return to the normal functioning of Parliament in March 2024, political polarisation remains high. This continues to negatively impact Parliament’s key legislative and oversight roles and extends delays in appointing individuals to key positions. Albania’s bodies in charge of the integration process are in place. These EU integration structures were further consolidated and successfully completed the screening process in November 2023. EU integration expertise, planning and interinstitutional mechanisms will need to be strengthened to be able to cope with the EU accession process. The government needs to intensify its efforts to engage in public communication on EU integration. The government continued to show its commitment to EU integration. Three waves of governmental changes occurred during the reporting period. A new major reform process on ‘good governance, rule of law and anti-corruption for Albania 2030’ was launched by Parliament, at the behest of the Prime Minister, yet without cross-party support.

Democratic governance and the rule of law require capable, accountable and effective public administration. In its 2014 Enlargement Strategy, the European Commission (EC) highlighted public administration reform (PAR) as one of the “fundamentals"" of the EU enlargement process. The 2023 EC communication on the EU Enlargement Policy reaffirms this conviction: “The functioning of democratic institutions and public administration reform continue to be among the three fundamentals for the EU accession process.” 2 Overall approach: Focus on implementation and results, analysing a variety of primary data sources against precise criteria and benchmarks for an objective and balanced assessment The updated 2023 edition of The Principles of Public Administration reflects the most recent international standards, applicable EU acquis and citizen expectations for modern public administration in Europe. Endorsed by the OECD and the European Commission, it covers the same broad scope and thematic areas as the previous edition. The Assessment Methodology of the Principles of Public Administration 3 contains a set of standard indicators that SIGMA applies consistently to measure the state of play against the Principles, including the preconditions and enablers for successful reforms (appropriate laws, policies, procedures, institutional structures and human resources); the public administration’s actual implementation practices; and subsequent results (how the administration performs in practice).

In the new Assessment Methodology, more than half of all criteria focus on implementation practices and results. While the overall approach recognises that no single measurement method can fully cover the complex issues related to all organisational and behavioural aspects of public administration, SIGMA relies on information from a comprehensive range of sources: administrative data from public registries; national statistics; legislation reviews and government reports; citizen, business, public servant and contracting authority surveys; case reviews of sample government documentation; and over 100 interviews with public servants and civil society. This information is cross-checked and triangulated to arrive at a balanced assessment. 1 OECD (2023), The Principles of Public Administration, OECD, Paris, https://www.sigmaweb.org/publications/Principles-of-Public-Administration-2023.pdf. 2 European Commission (2023), 2023 Communication on EU Enlargement Policy, p. 2, https://neighbourhood-enlargement.ec.europa.eu/system/files/2023- 11/COM_2023_690%20Communication%20on%20EU%20Enlargement%20Policy_and_Annex.pdf. 3 OECD (2024), Assessment Methodology of the Principles of Public Administration, OECD, Paris, https://www.sigmaweb.org/publications/Assessment-Methodology-Principles-Public-Administration.pdf.

Introduction 8 | PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION IN ALBANIA 2024 A regional series with long-term perspective This monitoring report assesses the state of play in public administration and progress in improving its quality. Given the geostrategic importance of the Western Balkans to the European Union and the ongoing EU accession negotiations, SIGMA conducts regular monitoring of the region. While SIGMA’s assessments in 2015, 2017 and 2021 covered the full scope of the Principles of Public Administration, this 2024 report also addresses all Principles and provides a comprehensive and detailed picture of the state of public administration in the region. This report is based on the Assessment Methodology developed to accompany the updated Principles of Public Administration (2023). While the narrative sections clearly describe developments since the last assessment and enable comparisons with previous monitoring, the significant methodological differences between this report and previous ones make comparisons of indicator values inapplicable. Key insights and recommendations for decision makers, and detailed performance data for practitioners Thirty-two Principles make up the framework for the six thematic areas, and each Principle has one or two indicators. There are 36 indicators in total, with 289 sub-indicators and 1 732 individual criteria.

The structure of the report mirrors that of the Principles. Each Principle contains a dedicated overview of associated indicator(s) and a summary analysis of the main strengths and weaknesses. Analytical findings and the most relevant recommendations are provided to guide reform efforts and inform the policy dialogue and discussions within the government administration and between the European Commission and the Government. SIGMA provides an executive brief and summaries for each of the six thematic areas to facilitate understanding at different levels of detail and insight. While the monitoring report shows overall indicator values only, the SIGMA data portal 5 offers a detailed criteria-level analysis. SIGMA wishes to thank the Government for its collaboration in providing the necessary administrative data and documentation, as well as for its active engagement during the validation process to ensure the factual accuracy of all information used.

The screening is based on the enhanced enlargement methodology, which was adopted in 2020 and organises the negotiating chapters in thematic clusters in order to inject dynamism into the negotiating process and to foster cross-fertilisation of efforts beyond individual chapters. These thematic clusters bring together the chapters / areas according to broader themes and will allow a stronger focus on core sectors. Within each individual cluster, screening is carried out through meetings on a chapter-by-chapter basis. The substance of those clusters and chapters, as set out in Annex II of the negotiating framework, mirror the requirements for membership stemming from the Copenhagen criteria. This report provides an assessment of where Albania stands in terms of alignment and capacity to apply the acquis in cluster 6. The negotiating framework also refers to the possibility of accelerated integration. At the bilateral meetings Albania has requested participation in certain areas before accession. This report provides the Commission’s opinion and answer to these requests.

It is important to continue the dialogue with civil society and other stakeholders, with the aim of ensuring the support of citizens for the EU accession process. Albania is expected to strategically communicate the benefits and obligations of the accession process to its public. 3 A) INTRODUCTION The enhanced enlargement methodology1, as reflected in the Negotiating Framework with Albania, puts the negotiating chapters of the EU acquis into clusters. The External Relations cluster includes two chapters of the EU acquis: ⎯ Under Chapter 30, External Relations covers EU legislation in the area of the common commercial policy stemming from both the EU’s multilateral and bilateral trade commitments, and from a number of autonomous preferential trade measures. It also covers the EU´s humanitarian aid and development policy. ⎯ Under Chapter 31, Foreign, Security and Defence Policy covers the common foreign and security policy (CFSP) and the common security and defence policy (CSDP) and is based on legal acts, including legally binding international agreements, and on political documents. The chapters under the External Relations cluster should not be seen in isolation, as several have commonalities and so interact with each other to be mutually reinforcing. For example, External Relations and the Foreign, Security, and Defence Policy are closely related in defining and shaping the EU foreign action.",239,True,False,False,False,0.0

This screening report is structured according to the respective areas and chapters of the cluster. Each area/chapter starts with a short overview of the main content of the EU acquis / European standards. Each thematic area within a chapter then first summarises the country’s presentations and the outcome of the expert discussions at the bilateral screening meeting, followed by the Commission’s assessment in chapter 30 and assessment in chapter 31. In the last section, from its findings the Commission draws recommendations for the next steps in the accession negotiations process in the present cluster. Albania stated that it accepts the acquis in the chapters of cluster 6. It reserved however the right to request transitional arrangements in certain limited areas of the acquis in this cluster at a later stage in the negotiations. 1 COM(2020) 57 final 4 B) CHAPTER 30 - EXTERNAL RELATIONS The EU has a common commercial policy towards third countries, based on multilateral and bilateral agreements and autonomous measures. There are also EU rules in the field of humanitarian and development policy.

The EU acquis in the field of the common commercial policy consists mainly of directly binding EU legislation which does not require transposition into national law. This EU legislation results from the EU’s multilateral and bilateral trade commitments, as well as from a number of autonomous preferential trade measures and specific trade rules. In the area of export, credits and export controls of dual-use goods, some elements of the acquis require earlier preparations in order to have fully capable administrations from the day of accession. Applicant countries are required to progressively align their policies towards third countries and their positions within international organisations (particularly the World Trade Organisation [WTO]) with the policies and positions adopted by the Union. In the area of humanitarian aid and development policy, EU Member States need to comply with EU legislation and international commitments and ensure the capacity to participate in the EU’s development and humanitarian policies. Candidate countries are required to progressively align their policies towards third countries and its positions within international organisations with the policies and positions adopted by the Union and its Member States.

It consists of three units headed by a director. The department has a total of nine staff of which two are currently being recruited. Albania plans to strengthen the administrative capacities of its Foreign Trade Affairs Directorate and to put more emphasis on the training of its staff. It also plans to conduct impact analyses and raise awareness among the business community regarding the impacts and benefits of the EU integration in this field. b. Commission assessment Overall, Albania is partially aligned with the EU acquis in the field of the common commercial policy. The country needs to apply all the directly binding EU legislation in this field by the date of accession. While the institutional set-up and coordination mechanism are in place, some of the positions at the Ministry’s Trade Directorate remain unfilled. Administrative capacity needs to be enhanced to ensure that its international agreements are brought in conformity with the EU acquis and that all directly binding EU legislation is effectively applied by the date of accession.

The country became a WTO member on 8 September 2000. Regarding goods, all of Albania’s WTO-agreed tariffs are bound ad valorem and tariff reductions were phased out by 2009. The WTO bound rates range mostly between 5% and 15% (20% for sensitive products). The most favoured nation (MFN) average applied rate was 3.6% in 2022, 7.7% for agricultural products and 2.9% for industrial products. Regarding services, under the GATS (General Agreement on Trade in Services), Albania has undertaken broad Market Access and National Treatment Commitments, although Mode 4 “Movement of natural persons” has some limitations included in the horizontal part of the schedule of specific commitments which affect all services sectors included in the Schedule. Since accession, Albania has accepted three multilateral instruments: in 2009 the Agreement on Trade- Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS), in 2016 the Trade Facilitation Agreement (TFA), and in 2023, the Agreement on Fisheries Subsidies. It is also a party to the plurilateral agreements on Trade in Civil Aircraft and Information Technology (ITA).",238,True,True,True,False,0.0

It is also a party to the plurilateral agreements on Trade in Civil Aircraft and Information Technology (ITA). In addition, the country is an observer and negotiating accession to the Agreement on Government Procurement (GPA). Albania also participates in joint initiatives such as the joint initiative on Services Domestic Regulation; the E-commerce moratorium; and the Investment Facilitation for Development (IFD). Since its membership, Albania has not had any dispute settlement case within the WTO. b. Commission assessment Albania is aligned in its foreign trade policy with that of the EU in the WTO. It has not had any dispute settlement case within the WTO since its membership. The country still needs to conclude its accession to the GPA. I.C REGIONAL/BILATERAL FRAMEWORK OF THE COMMON COMMERCIAL POLICY a. Country presentation Within the bilateral and regional framework of the common commercial policy, Albania applies five Free Trade Agreements (FTAs): with the EU under the Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA) since 2006; the Central European Free Trade Agreement (CEFTA) since 2007; Türkiye since 2008; the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) since 2010; and the United Kingdom within the Partnership, Trade and Cooperation Agreement since 2021.

The EU and CEFTA are by far Albania’s biggest FTA partners, covering 60% of its imports and over 90% of its exports. All the FTAs include a denouncement or withdrawal and expiration clause to ensure that the agreements can be denounced by the date of EU accession. There are no ongoing negotiations for new trade agreements nor any dispute settlement case with the country’s FTA partners. Albania maintains 46 bilateral investment treaties of which 23 with EU Member States. Albania plans to terminate each bilateral investment treaty or to align them with the EU acquis by the date of accession. b. Commission assessment Albania currently applies five Free Trade Agreements (FTAs), all of which include a termination clause.

From the day of accession, Albania also needs to implement Regulation (EU) 1219/2012 establishing transitional arrangements for bilateral investment agreements between Member States and third countries. I.D THE EU’S AUTONOMOUS TRADE PREFERENTIAL REGIMES a. Country presentation Albania does not apply a Generalised System of Preferences (GSP) but is a beneficiary of the GSP of other countries4. The country also benefits from the EU’s unilateral autonomous trade preferences on certain agricultural products laid out in Regulation (EU) 2024/823 on exceptional trade measures for countries and territories participating in or linked to the Stabilisation and Association Process, which applies until the end of 2025. The legal framework for autonomous measures in the national legislation is laid down in the Union Customs Code5 and in its Implementing Provisions6. b.

Country presentation The legal and institutional framework for export control of dual-use goods is regulated by the Law on the State Control over the Import-Export Activity of Military Equipment and Dual-use Goods and Technologies8, and by two Council of Ministries Decisions9. The legislation governing the list of dual-use items is aligned with Annex I of Regulation (EU) 2021/821 setting up a Union regime for the control of exports, brokering, technical assistance, transit and transfer of dual-use items. The country plans to adopt legislation aligning with the new features of the Regulation (EU) 2021/821 in 2025 and to update the National Control List of dual-use items, including military items with the latest EU lists. Finally, it plans to make the e-licencing software operational and connected with the government portal in 2024. In terms of the institutional set-up and administrative capacity, the Ministry of Defence leads the policy- making in this field, in cooperation with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Ministry of Interior.

Despite the impact of the global economic downturn, the country remained resilient and grew close to 6 per cent on average in the post pandemic years, on the back of record tourism seasons. However, Albania's convergence with EU standards remains slow, with living standards below EU averages, highlighting persistent gaps. Albania shares some structural challenges with its Western Balkan peers, such as high youth unemployment and slow labour productivity growth. Notwithstanding efforts to boost economic complexity through foreign investment, Albania remains a net importer of goods, with low- complexity exports in sectors like clothing, mining, and agriculture. Despite stable and well capitalised banking sector, lending to private sector in Albania is lagging Western Balkan peers. Albania, with a lower carbon intensity than its peers, relies predominantly on hydropower as its primary electricity source. This dependence, however, makes production vulnerable to weather fluctuations, resulting in needs for energy imports.

Ensuring flexibility and capacity of the grid to absorb new intermittent renewable energy capacities, especially with the plan to further scale-up renewable energy and with the integration with EU network and electricity markets, will be critical to increase resilience of the energy sector and achieve Albania’s goal of becoming a net exporter of energy. Since the last country strategy period, Albania has made progress in judiciary and public administration reforms, but further efforts are needed to address informality in the economy, improve the business climate, regional connectivity and align institutional frameworks with the EU acquis.

Executive Summary The period under review is marked by a major event for Albania - the first intergovernmental conference for EU accession negotiations took place in July 2022. The start of accession negotiations during a period of accession fatigue and increasing conditionality is not only an achievement in itself but also a reflection of the country’s pursuit of painful reforms in the crucial areas of democratization, economy and governance. Reform progress has been particularly notable in the area of the rule of law, which has traditionally been an area resistant to change, and has become a focus of EU conditionality. The election of a president in 2022 from the ranks of professional civil servants, without links to politics, promises to finally bring to office a person who can stand above the parties, improve the system of checks and balances, and reduce interinstitutional fights and polarization. A major judiciary reform started in 2016 has also continued, with the extension of the vetting process and the completion of new structures, such as those focused on high-level corruption. However, institutional frictions, political polarization, counter-productive political fights, the widespread patronage system and scarce resources in general are still holding back some of the ongoing reforms.

The country has pursued reforms and improved important indices of monetary and fiscal stability, the welfare system and sustainable development. The price hikes, which reached a historic high in July 2022, have prompted the government to allocate about 2% of GDP to support pensioners, vulnerable households, farmers and transport companies. The central bank has also embarked on a gradual policy of normalization, raising the policy rate. Importantly, the Albanian economy has shown resilience, rebounding more than expected following a major earthquake and the COVID-19 pandemic. Real GDP growth climbed to 8.1% in 2021 and 6% in 2022; as a result of the higher GDP denominator, the public debt declined from a peak of 74.5% of GDP in 2020 to 73.1% in 2021.

However, many of the country’s achievements are still a work in progress, and the overall effort remains a work in progress. A major challenge that cuts across almost all areas of reform is the strong role of the international community in the process and the lack of full local ownership. For example, the ongoing judiciary reform has been almost entirely drafted, negotiated, funded and supervised by international actors. As of now, it is still not clear whether the country will manage to sustain the current reform after the unavoidable withdrawal of its international sponsors. History and Characteristics of Transformation The legacies of the communist regime and the chaotic regime change in the early 1990s are often cited as the most important determinants of Albania’s difficulties in consolidating democracy, a market economy and good governance. The communist regime that ruled the country for over 40 years (1944 - 1991) was one of the most unorthodox dictatorships in the communist world. Utilizing Stalinist tactics of repression, the regime eradicated all forms of opposition, preventing the development of organized movements and the emergence of experienced leaders capable of leading a transition to democracy.",232,True,False,True,True,0.0

The regime’s fall in the early 1990s came amidst tumultuous and occasionally violent protests, leaving behind a population profoundly skeptical of governmental institutions, as well as a crumbling economy, divisive politics and a dearth of individuals dedicated to democracy. Albania’s challenging transition was predictably characterized by a significant institutional crisis and the disintegration of the state. In January 1997, Albanian citizens took to the streets to protest against the “anti-communist” government, which had deteriorated into a one-man rule relying on the country’s security forces and a personally controlled patronage system to solidify a system reminiscent of the previous one-party rule. The economic transition was mishandled, exemplified by pyramid schemes, corrupt privatization and illicit trade with the former Yugoslav states (under embargo at the time), which undermined the impact of initial economic reforms.

BTI 2024 | Albania 5 Albania thus had to start once again amid an acrimonious political atmosphere, a polarized society and the absence of state authority, this time without even minimal social and security services. International intervention was necessary to bring about any sense of normalcy and to jump-start institution-building. However, alliances between key political structures, powerful businesses and organized crime flourished during this chaotic and unruly period, fostering state capture and the strength of a patronage system that has played a major role in the country’s transition. Consecutive governments continued to exploit power and use the state as a piece of property to distribute among family members and political cronies as a means of consolidating their hold on power.

The institutional settlement excludes any influence of religious dogmas on the legal order and political institutions of the state. A significant number of Albanians, including opinion makers, politicians and citizens, demonstrate support for the Albanian secular system and the exclusion of religion from the public sphere. Centralized organizations representing each of the four communities also tend to back the institutional separation and independence between the state and religious communities. Attempts by different transnational movements to introduce alternative models and ideals, including radicalized ideologies, have encountered resistance among post-communist Albanians. Radical ideas, if present, are typically limited to marginal groups that operate in more globalized online spaces.

Our primary objective is to assess the level of awareness regarding different forms of violence children may encounter, the prevailing attitudes towards such acts, and the practices that either perpetuate or mitigate these behaviors. Through this survey, we seek not only to quantify the extent of the issue but also to understand the nuanced factors that contribute to its persistence. We are hopeful that the findings of this survey will help construct meaningful and effective strategies to prevent and address violence against children. This endeavor is a collaborative effort, involving UNICEF, the Government of Albania, other development partners, and Civil Society Organizations (CSOs) working daily to ameliorate children’s lives.

Importantly, this recent legislation makes the reporting of VAC in all forms a legal obligation for all adults in Albania. However, there is little evidence of either an increase in reporting of VAC or a decrease in the level of violence itself, particularly within the home. Aims and objectives To better understand the dynamics of the current situation with regard to VAC, and the apparent lack of change in behaviour and practices, UNICEF Albania, with support from the Embassy of Sweden, commissioned a Knowledge, Attitudes and Practices (KAP) study of adults towards violence against children. The study had three discrete aims, as follows: • To determine the knowledge among adults of what constitutes VAC. • To determine how adults understand their legal responsibilities vis-à-vis witnessing, or practising VAC, or both. • To explore perceptions on the prevalence of VAC in Albania’s communities. The specific objectives of the study comprised the following: • To determine knowledge of what constitutes the various forms of VAC, across all domains - home, school, community and online - and including all forms of violence within and across these domains. • To assess the extent to which adults understand the intersectional nature of different forms of VAC.",233,True,False,True,False,0.0

This includes understanding the knowledge of duty-bearers and those placed in a position of care for children. • To gauge the degree of readiness to report and disclose VAC, and attitudes and trust towards the reporting mechanisms, and barriers to reporting. • To determine the practices and responses of adults within Albania when witnessing or being alerted to different forms of VAC.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 1.201 aduls (aged 18-64) interviewed THE REPORTING OF VIOLENCE AGAINST CHILDREN IN ALBANIA EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 9 Key findings Many adults feel that their communities are unsafe for children, whether when walk- ing in their neighbourhoods or even at home, after dark, while their perceptions of safety for adults in the community are generally at a higher level than for children. The majority of adults in Albania do not think that VAC or domestic violence is common in the country. However, a substantial percentage acknowledge that it occurs, or is even very common. When asked specifically about how common specific forms of VAC are, more adults tend to think they are common or even very common. In all, 27 percent felt that harsh or physical punishment of children was very common, with another 67 percent thinking it does occur. Meanwhile, 60 percent believe cyberbullying is widespread and 57 percent that school bullying is very common.",224,True,False,False,False,0.0

Meanwhile, 60 percent believe cyberbullying is widespread and 57 percent that school bullying is very common. These findings suggest that adults are more aware of specific types of violence that children experience, but may not always consider them as violent acts that are included in the definition of VAC. When asked about specific forms of sexual VAC, the majority of adults reported that they think sexual abuse of children, sexual harassment, stalking of girls and the sexual abuse of children by other children is either common or very common. Such perceptions have been largely informed by indirect experience or exposure to infor- mation in the public domain rather than by direct personal experience of different forms of violence. Nevertheless, adults were more likely to report personal knowledge of child maltreatment or neglect in their community than they are of the other forms of violence. Perceptions and experiences among adults of both domestic violence and VAC, and feelings of safety in the community and at home, are likely to impact the attitudes of adults in the country towards the various forms of VAC, as well as different practices and behaviours, including reporting, within the community and within homes and families.

However, the country faces challenges stemming from declining human capital due to factors such as migration, economic inactivity, including of women, and the underutilization of existing talent pools. Enabling women’s economic participation is critical for Albania’s trajectory to a high-income country. Actively engaging, nurturing, and optimizing the diverse tal- ents and capabilities of the population, especially of inactive segments is para- mount to underpinning this growth trajectory. Gender and social inclusion lie at the heart of Albania’s development path and thus demand high-level attention and commitment. In recent years, Albania has made significant strides in narrowing gender dispari- ties across various socio-economic indicators. Trends indicate a positive trajecto- ry, with notable improvements in areas such as education, healthcare, and political representation. However, while progress has been made, persistent gender gaps continue to present challenges, particularly in the realms of unpaid labor, econom- ic opportunity, and entrepreneurship. This Country Gender Assessment provides empirical evidence and analyzes gen- der equality in Albania.

Through this lens, the report scrutinizes recent progress and lingering challenges across three critical dimensions: Endowments, Economic opportunities, and Voice and Agency. Extensive research was conduct- ed drawing from various data sources to gauge indicators such as health, educa- tion, labor market dynamics, and gender-based violence, among others.1 This report updates and complements past work on gender equality in Albania. The analysis relies primarily on the WDI, 2019-2021 Labor Force Surveys (LFS), 2023 Life in Transition Survey, 2019 Enterprise Survey, 2021 Global Findex and other data available through the World Bank Gender Data portal, as well as a vari- ety of secondary sources, which provide a broad picture of the key gender issues in Albania. The results of the analysis suggest that there are significant gender 1 This note focuses on gender disparities specifically hindering the well-being and economic welfare of women in Kosovo.

The highlights can be summarized as follows: • Albania could reap substantial economic benefits from reducing gender gaps, as highlighted by the percent value of Gender Equality Gain Index (GEGI), identifying the potential rise in long-run GDP per capita from equalizing em- ployment rates between genders. • Gaps in primary and secondary education are small, while gaps in tertiary education show that women dominate university enrolments. Along with the closing gender gaps and the outpacing of men in tertiary education enroll- ment, women consistently outperform men in academic assessments. • Gender gaps persist in economic opportunities, including lower labor force participation, employment rates, and ownership of enterprises. Despite women’s increasing educational attainment and delayed marriage, these gains have yet to translate into commensurate improvements in economic prospects. A large percentage of women work as unpaid family workers, re- flecting the high rates of underemployment for women. Women are mainly concentrated in less profitable economic sectors and occupations such as manufacturing and agriculture. • A significant gender gap is evident in tertiary education enrollment, with women dominating at both the bachelor’s and master’s levels. • A phenomenon known as motherhood penalty is observable in Albania.",238,True,False,True,False,0.0

The transition to adulthood differsbetween genders: young men typically expe- rience a decrease in inactivity rates and an increase in employment, while young women often transition from school to inactivity. Employment rates between men and women diverge at the time of family formation. • The government’s commitment to Gender-Responsive Budgeting (GRB) un- derscores a strong sense of national ownership and dedication to advancing gender equality agendas across all levels of governance. Central budgetary institutions have made notable strides in embracing GRB, evidenced by the rise in gender-specific budget allocations, but progress within local govern- ments has been slower. Addressing gender equality offers opportunities. In addition to its intrinsic value, promoting gender equality is a central priority towards achieving inclusive growth and reducing poverty. Promoting women’s economic opportunities, access to en- dowments, and voice and agency is fundamental in tackling some of Albania’s main policy challenges, including raising labor productivity, promoting private sec- tor development, and fostering resilience.

LEGAL AND INSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK Gender equality in Albania has increasingly received attention in the political and legislative arena. The continuous commitment to gender equality has resulted in the ratification of various international conventions focused on gender equal- ity and the fight against gender-based violence. The legislative and institutional framework on gender equality in Albania is quite comprehensive and has evolved to keep up with international changes and developments. Overall, Albania’s legislative framework for gender equality has made significant progress, receiving an overall score of 91.3 out of 100 in 2023 from the World Bank’s Women, Business, and the Law (WBL) 1.0. index.2 This marks a notable im- provement since 1975 (Figure 1). In the 1970s and 80s, a typical woman had just over half of the legal rights of men in access to economic opportunities (WBL index 59.4). With the fall of communism and the adaptation of the open market economy, the late 1990s and early 2000s showed improvements in the legal environment in the labor market. During this period, the WBL index jumped from 59.4 to 80. Until 2015, the index continued to increase to 85.6. In the last years since 2015, the WBL index has reached 91.3.

This was based on their obligations under the Albanian legislation, the Convention for the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW), the Istanbul Convention, and European Court of Human Rights jurisprudence on cases of this nature.

Of the 28 perpetrators, 26 were men and boys; only in two cases the crimes were committed by a woman and a girl. Six of the perpetrators died after committing the crime - five committed suicide and one lost his life trying to avoid arrest by the police. Two perpetrators died in pretrial detention, when investigations were still ongoing. According to information available, of the 32 cases of killings of women and girls, 24 fulfil the criteria to qualify as femicides, or killings because of gender.

Regarding motivation, in most of the cases the women and girls were killed for reasons such as jealousy, refusal to accept separation/divorce, refusal to accept the fact that the victim was in a new relationship after separation with the perpetrator, and/or out of revenge for reporting them to the police. In the majority of the cases, the killings were brutal and involved the use of firearms, sharp or blunt implements, and the exercise of physical force. 3 The countries selected for the purposes of this comparison are: North Macedonia, Montenegro, Serbia, Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Romania, Malta, Hungary, Greece, Czechia, and Italy.",245,True,False,True,False,0.0

See: https://dataunodc.un.org/dp- femicide. 7 According to the collected data, in about 90 per cent of the cases the victims of femicide had suffered abuse in the hands of the perpetrators even prior to being killed but only six of them (25 per cent) had filed complaints with the police. Two women had been granted protective orders (IPO/POs) at the time they were killed. None of the women was in possession of an Immediate Preliminary Protection Order (IPPO) issued by the police. With respect to crime prevention, issues identified in cases where there had been reporting of prior abuse to the police, relate mainly to a failure to properly assess risk factors and to take prompt measures to protect these women, lack of adequate coordination between the responsible structures, a failure to monitor already granted protective measures in line with the procedures set out in the legal provisions in force, and lack of effective support services for victims and rehabilitation services for perpetrators.",231,True,False,True,False,0.0

These same issues were also identified by the Group of Experts on Action against Violence against Women and Domestic Violence (GREVIO) in its First Thematic Evaluation Report on Albania, published in September 2024.5 On the other hand, the high number of murdered women and girls who had not previously reported abuse to the police highlights the need to further raise awareness in the community and across the institutions. Four of the women and girls were killed a few days after the perpetrators were released from prison after serving sentences on charges of domestic violence under Article 130/a of the Criminal Code.

Establishment of rehabilitation programmes and their implementation in all institutions for the execution of criminal decisions (IECD) and obligatory attendance of perpetrators of gender-based violence in such programmes, are other issues that must be duly addressed.

The availability of data varies by population group; disaggregation is highest for refugees and internally displaced persons and lowest for asylum-seekers, returnees (whether internally displaced persons or refugees) and stateless persons.

An analysis of annual country reports for 2023 shows that at least 72 per cent of country operations have incorporated disability inclusion into programming (against 68 per cent in 2022). Sixty-three per cent of country operations reported activities that incorporated the needs of forcibly displaced LGBTIQ+ persons. Disaggregated data on activities for older persons was provided by 13 per cent of country operations.

Thirty-one country operations incorporated direct programming on youth engagement in their strategy for 2024.

The new organization-wide core indicator, “Extent participation of displaced and stateless persons across programme phases is supported”, was reported on by 39 country operations. Of these 39, 25 (64 per cent) reported that UNHCR supported the participation of refugees and asylum- seekers in an “extensive” manner.

UNHCR conducted in-depth mapping and analysis of FRMs in the East and Horn of Africa and the Great Lakes region, in Southern Africa, and in the Asia and Pacific region. The mapping evaluated the available standard operating procedures and tools used to collect, record, refer, respond to and analyse community feedback, which informs programming.

Electoral Code and Voting System: The Electoral Code mandates that political party candidate lists for parliamentary elections must include at least 30% representation of both genders. The 2024 amendments to the Electoral Code replaced the preferential voting system, allowing voters to choose their preferred party or coalition and cast a vote for their preferred candidate. Mandates are distributed based on votes received in each district, starting with the multi-name list and then preferential votes if necessary. The 2024 amendments to the Electoral Code also require the gender quota to be fulfilled in the final outcome list subject to preferential voting.

Political parties should scrutinize their internal processes for selecting, identifying, and supporting women mayor candidates. Consider introducing a quota for women mayors in the Electoral Code, including for nominated positions such as deputy mayors and administrators of local government units. Consider introducing changes to ensure that women counselors who resign are replaced with women.

Active engagement of civil society organizations (CSOs), mainly through joint committees at both national and local levels, is essential to ensure that the integration process is participatory and representative. However, civil society’s role in the EU accession process remains limited, with slow progress in implementing the commitments outlined in the 2019-2023 Roadmap for Civil Society. A comprehensive regulatory framework for public funding of CSOs is still lacking, leaving institutions without standardized procedures or transparent criteria for grant allocation. Despite the presence of the National Council for Civil Society (NCCS) as the main advisory body, the space for meaningful CSO participation remains constrained, with limited opportunities for input and weak follow-up mechanisms. Furthermore, the CSO sector continues to face structural challenges, including fragmentation, donor dependency, and a concentration of activity in urban centers, despite the presence of active grassroots initiatives across the country. The civil society sector in Albania is currently facing significant challenges due to budget cuts from key donors, including the U.S. Government and several EU countries.

Definition of Human Capital One of the founders of the concept of human capital, the Nobel winning scholar Gary Becker, considers human capital to be “the knowledge, information, ideas, skills, and health of individuals”2 (Becker [2002]. This definition takes a wider approach to human capital compared to what, e.g., the OECD3 proposes, focusing more its economic dimension when defining human capital as “the knowledge, skills, competencies and other attributes embodied in individuals that are relevant to economic activity”.

In each case, human capital is considered to be a fundamental factor for economic prosperity. The World Bank in its 2017’s Human Capital Project uses a more complete definition of Human Capital, which is widely and commonly understood and agreed by development partners and many countries at all income levels: “Human capital consists of the knowledge, skills, and health that people accumulate throughout their lives, enabling them to realize their potential as productive members of society”4. Building on this foundation, Nobel Prize winner Theodore W. Schultz's seminal work provides additional depth to our understanding by identifying five key categories of human investment activities: (1) health facilities and services, (2) on-the-job training, (3) formal education, (4) adult study programs, and (5) migration to change job prospects. This framework emphasizes that people invest in themselves not for immediate consumption but with expectation of future gain, and such improvements amount to investment capital. Based on this work, Kevin McNamara describes human capital stocks to represent the existing skills and knowledge base of a workforce that supports a community's economic structure, while human capital flows refer to the rate at which new skills and knowledge are being added to this existing foundation through ongoing investments and development activities.",246,True,False,True,False,0.0

Reports discuss ‘economic reintegration’ with reference to the key activities associated with the process of economic reintegration, such as vocational training; access to internships; access to employment and entrepreneurship opportunities; support while engaged in new livelihood activities; financial support; environment and market assessments; and monitoring and evaluation of economic reintegration.1 Economic reintegration of trafficking survivors can therefore be understood as the process through which they access a range of vo- cational training and employment services, in order to be economically stable, and no longer at risk of human trafficking. The reintegration of survivors of trafficking in Albania derives from the National Action Plan against Trafficking in Human Beings 2021-2023. There are several normative frameworks in the country that outline the support that should be provided to survivors across the areas of em- ployment, health, housing and economic assistance. Despite the presence of these frameworks, the available literature suggests that there are gaps and challenges in Albania’s economic rein- tegration support for trafficking survivors.",219,True,False,True,False,0.0

Despite the presence of these frameworks, the available literature suggests that there are gaps and challenges in Albania’s economic rein- tegration support for trafficking survivors. For example, Ramaj (2021) highlighted the challenges for survivors in accessing employment, and argued that employment services in Albania are time-consuming and demotivating for trafficking survivors.2 The present study sets out to contrib- ute to the knowledge base regarding economic reintegration of trafficking survivors in Albania by providing a new perspective on the subject - one that explores the experiences of both survivors and frontline professionals in accessing or providing, respectively, economic reintegration sup- port and other related services. Aim and objectives The central aim of the present study is to strengthen the understanding of the challenges that survi- vors and frontline professionals (service providers employed in state agencies and non-governmen- tal organisations (NGOs) face in accessing and providing economic reintegration support in Albania. The study objectives were to undertake the following: • Examine and document the perspectives of survivors and frontline professionals (em- ployed in state agencies and NGOs) regarding gaps and challenges in accessing or pro- viding quality and sustainable economic reintegration support (such as vocational train- ing, internships and employment). • Explore these challenges at different levels, namely those of individual, relationship, community and society.",242,True,False,True,False,0.0

Fourteen interviews were conducted with traf- ficking survivors, and 27 interviews and 6 FGDs were held with key informants, including social workers, social service administrators and shelter staff. The criteria for the survivors to participate included: • Being of age 18 years or above; • Being trafficked Albanian nationals, including minority groups (not foreign nationals); • Having been receiving economic reintegration support for at least three months; • Having, at the time of the interview, received support any time during the last two years; • Having been screened by their caseworker as able to answer the interview questions without becoming distressed. Only trafficking survivors who met the above inclusion criteria were invited to participate in the study. Findings Vocational training The study identified that it is important for the vocational training options to match, to the maximum extent possible, the survivors’ level of education with the employment and business opportunities. This is important for ensuring that survivors are able to find decent employment following completion of vocational training. Furthermore, it is important for survivors to have in- formation on all training options available to them, and to choose the ones they wish to pursue, otherwise, if they are not interested, there is a strong chance they will cease their participation.",221,True,False,False,False,0.0

In addition, the study identified that vocational training should include life skills and business man- agement components, and that certification should be provided as it would support a valuable pathway to employment. Of the 14 interviewed survivors, 13 (93%) were female, and 1 (7%) was male. At the time of interview, the survivors were of age 18-36 years.

Key informants reported that it is important that frontline pro- fessionals follow the advisory cycle, which provides a framework for the survivor to explore a range of vocational training opportunities, while all the time being guided by advice. Survivors face a number of challenges in accessing quality vocational training, including lack of access to free childcare, difficulties accessing vocational training in rural areas of the country and the short duration and low quality of some trainings provided in vocational training centres. Internships and employment support The study identified that internships are a valuable learning opportunity, which should precede employment for survivors who have not previously worked. The study further identified that companies that will employ survivors as interns must be vetted in order to ensure the safety and security of survivors. Key informants highlighted that it is important for internships to be remunerated. For survivors who have not previously worked, remuneration helps them become accustomed to receiving regular paycheques from their employer, and increases their budget management skills and overall confidence to enter the labour market.

Seven interviewed survivors (50%) were, at the time of interview, employed in the same field in which they had trained: as a tailor, hairdresser, cook, car mechanic or other profession. The study identified some key challenges for survivors in entering and sustaining new employ- ment, including lack of decent job opportunities in Albania, lack of interest in the jobs, lack of ed- ucation, lack of affordable childcare, ongoing trauma and stigma. The study further identified that few survivors are successful in finding employment quickly after registering with the National Agency for Employment and Skills (NAES). Support to start a new business The study found that starting a business may be a very empowering experience for survivors. Through the processes of planning and managing, survivors can experience significant increases in business and financial management nous, and confidence. However, they face challenges in starting and maintaining their own business, including lack of business know-how, insufficient start-up capital, and the presence of business competition and stigma.

Other services that support economic reintegration The study identified that economic reintegration of trafficking survivors through vocational train- ing, internships, job placement and support to start a business does not occur in isolation of other support services. These were highlighted in the interviews and from the Focus group discussions 11 Economic reintegration of trafficking survivors in Albania (FGD) as education, healthcare, housing and economic assistance. The study further identified that free childcare is an important support service. Education support is critical to economic reintegration. The study found that young survivors who are supported to complete high school have a better chance of finding decent employment than those who have not completed high school, and survivors who complete higher (university) educa- tion have an even greater chance of finding decent professional work.

When supported, they can play vital roles in their households and communities. Gender denotes the roles of women and men in societies, which are often central to the way in which people deﬁne themselves and are deﬁned by others. Gender roles may change across cultures and over time. Gender often deﬁnes the duties, responsibilities, constraints, opportunities and privileges of women, men, girls and boys in any context. The principle of gender equality aﬃrms that all individuals regardless of their gender should enjoy rights, responsibilities and opportunities on equal terms. It implies respect for the interests, needs and priorities of all genders. Combating discrimination based on gender is inextricably linked to gender equality, since it challenges negative stereotypes and discrimination arising from prejudice. Women and girls ﬁll important roles in their communities and families and wider society and contribute in various ways to strengthening protection and solutions. Supporting the empowerment of women and girls is vital for dismantling gender barriers and reducing inequalities.

It initially identifies the multiple forms of violence that these women face and barriers to accessing services, based on different sources and data, including recommendations of human rights mechanisms and studies conducted by civil society organizations (CSOs). The paper then reviews the relevant international legal framework within the frameworks of the United Nations and Council of Europe, including the jurisprudence of their quasi-judicial or judicial bodies. This is followed by a brief analysis of the national legal framework to identify gaps requiring urgent attention as per international human rights law. The paper concludes with a number of practical recommendations to ensure adequate protection and support services for women with disabilities who are victims of violence, addressed to different stakeholders, but particularly government actors and CSOs. The methodology used for developing the analysis primarily comprised a desk review of key recent documents on this issue, including human rights reports on Albania, reports from CSOs working with women with disabilities, and other UN documents shared by the UN Gender Thematic and Results Group in Albania, among others.

Introduction Violence against women and girls is a widespread violation of human rights and the most serious manifestation of gender-based discrimination, and women and girls with disabilities face unique challenges that heighten their vulnerability. In Albania, societal stigma and systemic discrimination are compounded by insufficient legal protections and a lack of accessible and tailored support services. Consequently, women and girls with disabilities are at increased risk of violence, underscoring the urgent need for targeted interventions. To effectively combat violence against women and girls with disabilities in Albania, it is crucial to effectively implement and enhance legal frameworks with specific provisions for this demographic, as well as implement nationwide awareness campaigns that utilize accessible materials to reduce stigma. Public services must be fully accessible, with dedicated funding allocated to organizations serving these women. Emergency response services must be meticulously structured to address the unique requirements of women with disabilities thereby guaranteeing their safety in times of crisis and facilitating access to prompt assistance. Technology must be used to enhance accessibility for women with disabilities, creating accessible reporting mechanisms for cases of violence, and developing digital tools for education and raising awareness.",220,True,False,True,False,0.0

Those with intellectual disabilities and mental health conditions are particularly vulnerable due to difficulties in recognizing and reporting abuse. Women with physical, visual or speech disabilities often experience psychological and physical violence linked to caregiver dependency, compounded by societal prejudices that result in passive violence affecting their mental health. Common forms of abuse include withholding medication, home isolation due to broken mobility aids. Emotional violence, such as household members threatening to abandon those in wheelchairs or the possibility of institutionalization for girls with disabilities, illustrates the profound impact of emotional abuse in this context. Women with moderate or severe intellectual disabilities and mental health challenges are particularly vulnerable to sexual violence, human trafficking, prostitution and begging since their conditions can increase their risk of exploitation. Psychological violence driven by societal prejudice leads to violations of their rights to education, employment, family life and community inclusion. Financial pressures are also significant, as many women with disabilities are denied access to their properties and benefits, leading to institutionalization or abandonment.",250,True,False,False,False,0.0

Girls of age 14-18 years are most likely to be targeted for sex trafficking. A recent analysis of 99 human trafficking cases showed that 68 percent of traffickers were either close family members or had close social ties to the victims. Of the 99 cases, 31 percent were reported to be cases in which boyfriends had exploited victims, 25 percent were friends of the victim, and twelve percent involved family members. In 19 percent of cases victims were exploited by people they had met on social media. While we know, therefore, that Albanians are often trafficked by someone that they are close to, we lack further understanding on the ways in which traffickers recruit, exploit and control the victims who are known to them, and the effects of the relationships upon the victims’ escape and vulnerability to re-trafficking. The present study aims to address these knowledge gaps.

Aim and objectives The study adopted a qualitative approach. The methods used for this study were semi- structured interviews with 30 trafficking survivors and 14 key informants, as well as focus group discussions (FGDs) with 31 representatives of government agencies and non- government organisations (NGOs). Data collection was conducted during the period 17 May-30 July 2021.

According to them, the traffickers were either very wealthy, or very poor. Those described as wealthy were also reported as engaged in other criminal activities. Those described as poor were also often described as having debts accrued through gambling or alcohol or drug addiction, which they attempted to repay through the exploitation of victims. Recruitment tactics The present study identifies a number of novel tactics used by human traffickers to recruit potential victims. Currently, human traffickers in Albania carefully assess their potential victims in terms of vulnerabilities and desires, in order to establish the best approach for grooming them.

Traffickers also make efforts to groom the victim’s family by inserting themselves into the life of the victim and earning the family’s trust. Traffickers, especially young males, establish romantic relationships with sex trafficking victims (especially teenage girls), promising the victims marriage and children together. The report clearly highlights that one indicator of human trafficking in Albania today is the rushed nature of a romantic relationship. Traffickers quickly insert themselves into the life of the victim and their family, and then swiftly relocate them to another city or abroad. Social media are increasingly being used as a tool by male traffickers to identify potential young female victims with whom they can establish a false relationship before trafficking the women and girls for sexual exploitation in Albania or elsewhere. Female perpetrators play key roles in human trafficking offences: they act as the victim’s friend, but then lure them to the place of exploitation. Many female perpetrators are former trafficking victims themselves. For children who are trafficked by family members, recruitment tactics are not used but, rather, the notion of the child’s responsibility to financially support the family is manipulated in order to force children into exploitative labour.

In addition, they may keep the victims compliant through regularly drugging. The study uncovers some novel and important new findings with regard to 11 TRAFFICKED BY SOMEONE I KNOW traffickers’ control tactics. Known to the victim, the trafficker can manipulate them more easily (than those who are not known by their victims) through artificial debts and threats. Because the victim believes that they are in a relationship, or are close friends, with the trafficker, they comply when told that they have to service an artificial debt. Victims who know their trafficker are also easily controlled through threats against the victim’s family members because the victim knows that their trafficker is aware of their vulnerabilities, and has the address and other personal details of the family members.

Traffickers known by the victim can also easily control them by separating them from their family. For example, traffickers can create friction between the victim and their family members, and, later on, make the victim contact their family to tell them that they have moved abroad with their intimate partner or friend (trafficker) and wish to cut off contact with their family. This leaves the victim feeling that they have no family support, and thus nowhere to go and no one to help them. For interview participants who were trafficked when they were children, there was limited understanding when they were young that they were being exploited. The traffickers (often family members) simply exploited this lack of knowledge and understanding to keep the children obedient. Persistent threats of the child being forced to live on the street have a strong effect and prevent the child from fleeing situations of exploitation and abuse.

These Strategic Directions committed us to: During those five years, the challenges of forced displacement and statelessness have grown in scope, scale and complexity.

Inequalities have been worsened by the COVID-19 pandemic, new and intractable conflicts, and the climate crisis. These are shocks to the global system but their impact has been greatest on forcibly displaced and stateless persons, who are among the world’s most disadvantaged. These challenges will continue to compound pressures on the most marginalized and drive more complex displacements, including mixed movements of refugees, internally displaced people and migrants. Protecting, assisting, and upholding the rights and dignity of forcibly displaced and stateless people is a collective endeavour and a mutual responsibility. This is affirmed by the Global Compact on Refugees and the commitments made at the 2019 Global Refugee Forum. Time and time again, solidarity and international cooperation have proven essential to resolving the most formidable challenges.

Forcibly displaced and stateless women and girls are also experiencing deepening gender inequality, with diminished educational and livelihood opportunities, increased care responsibilities, and mounting risks of gender-based violence, abuse and exploitation.4 Closures of schools and universities have disproportionately affected forcibly displaced children, youth and adult learners, who were already at a disadvantage. Many forcibly displaced children, particularly girls, have been unable to return to school, reversing earlier progress in enrolments5 and worsening child protection risks. These effects will continue to reverberate in the medium and longer term. Second, political upheaval and conflict show few signs of abatement and have triggered new displacement and limited opportunities to return home. There were hopes that the pandemic would give way to ceasefires and create opportunities for peace. However, most conflicts across the globe continue unresolved, with growing signs of political repression and new waves of tension and violence.6 Even if the temperature of some conflicts has cooled, a failure to achieve a definitive and sustainable peace means that millions continue to endure forced displacement.

This growth in complex humanitarian emergencies is expected to continue. Furthermore, the nature of displacement is shifting. While most people who cross their national borders seek international protection in neighbouring countries, some move further afield, often making dangerous journeys. More and more, asylum-seekers move alongside migrants in mixed movements, and both groups face exploitation and risks from trafficking networks, criminal gangs and armed actors. Many suffer prolonged family separation, kidnapping, detention, and physical and sexual abuse, with children, adolescents and youth who are unaccompanied or separated from their families in particular danger. Increasingly, displaced populations move to urban areas and live under precarious conditions for many years without real prospects for finding solutions to their situation and for building a future. These shifts require more long-term engagement and comprehensive responses that include humanitarian action, sustainable peace and investment in development.

The Youth Guarantee Program aimed at including in the labor market of young people not in education, employment, vocational training, increasing the level of the minimum wage, reducing the gender gap in wages, or engaging in Global 6 Accelerator for Decent Work and Social Protection for Just Transitions, aiming at creating jobs and the development of skills in the main sectors of the environmental economy and digitalization, etc., are some of the concrete examples of measures undertaken to progress towards inclusive development, shared prosperity and decent work.

Good results are achieved in the protection against various forms of gender-based violence, but victims/survivors face problems in the effective implementation of legislation, specialized support services which need to expand and cover the entire territory of the country, information about their rights (especially when it comes to persons with disabilities in sight, hearing, etc. ), the impact of gender stereotypes and the blaming and prejudicial attitude that society holds in these matters, the increase in cases of femicide, as well as the problems in the operation and effectiveness of the Coordinated Referral Mechanisms of cases at the local level.",236,True,False,False,False,0.0

It evaluates legal and policy frameworks, identifies gender disparities across key sectors, and presents targeted recommendations to strengthen institutional reforms and gender-responsive policymaking. The report examines progress made, persisting challenges, and key opportunities in advancing gender equality within the EU accession process and Albania’s international commitments. By addressing gender inequalities across political, economic, and social domains, it serves as a strategic roadmap for policymakers, international organizations, and civil society, reinforcing gender equality as a cornerstone of Albania’s sustainable development and European integration agenda. Gender equality remains a fundamental priority in Albania’s economic, political, and social development.",231,True,False,True,True,0.0

Gender equality remains a fundamental priority in Albania’s economic, political, and social development. While the country has made notable legislative advancements, persistent challenges continue to hinder progress, particularly in women’s economic participation, political representation, access to justice, protection from gender-based violence (GBV), participation in climate decision- making, digital literacy, etc. Strengthening institutional coordination, enforcement mechanisms, and resource allocation is critical to ensuring that Albania’s policies and legal frameworks result in meaningful improvements for women and girls. Purpose and Objectives The CGEP serves as a strategic tool for policymakers, EU institutions, international organizations, and civil society actors in monitoring gender equality trends and shaping future policies. The report aims to: • Assess Albania’s progress in achieving gender equality and women’s empowerment from 2020-2025. • Evaluate the effectiveness of national policies, legislation, and institutional mechanisms in advancing gender equality. • Identify key gender-based barriers to economic participation, political leadership, and social inclusion. • Analyze Albania’s alignment with EU directives and key international frameworks, including the Convention for Elimination of all Forms of Violence Against Women (CEDAW), the Universal Periodic Review (UPR), the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), and the Council of Europe Convention of Combatting Violence against Women and Domestic Violence (Istanbul Convention).",237,True,False,True,True,0.0

Context and Alignment with International Commitments Albania has demonstrated a strong commitment to gender equality through its obligations under the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW), the Universal ALBANIA COUNTRY GENDER EQUALITY PROFILE 2025 4 Periodic Review (UPR), and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).",237,True,False,True,True,0.0

These commitments are further reflected in national priorities under the United Nations Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework (UNSDCF) 2022-2026, which integrates gender equality across governance, economic, and social development policies. Additionally, Albania’s EU accession process provides an opportunity to advance gender equality by aligning national policies with EU Gender Action Plan III (EU GAP III) 2021-2025, the EU acquis, and the new EU Roadmap for Women’s Rights, 2025. However, full alignment requires sustained political commitment, institutional capacity-building, and financial investment to integrate gender equality into legislation, labor policies, governance structures, and economic reforms. Scope and Methodology CGEP adopts a multi-dimensional methodology, combining both quantitative and qualitative analysis. The assessment is based on a detailed review of national legal and policy frameworks, EU accession requirements, and global commitments. It draws on data from national and international sources, including INSTAT (Albanian Institute of Statistics), the World Bank, and the European Institute for Gender Equality (EIGE).

It initially identifies the multiple forms of violence that these women face and barriers to accessing services, based on different sources and data, including recommendations of human rights mechanisms and studies conducted by civil society organizations (CSOs). The paper then reviews the relevant international legal framework within the frameworks of the United Nations and Council of Europe, including the jurisprudence of their quasi-judicial or judicial bodies. This is followed by a brief analysis of the national legal framework to identify gaps requiring urgent attention as per international human rights law. The paper concludes with a number of practical recommendations to ensure adequate protection and support services for women with disabilities who are victims of violence, addressed to different stakeholders, but particularly government actors and CSOs. The methodology used for developing the analysis primarily comprised a desk review of key recent documents on this issue, including human rights reports on Albania, reports from CSOs working with women with disabilities, and other UN documents shared by the UN Gender Thematic and Results Group in Albania, among others.

Introduction Violence against women and girls is a widespread violation of human rights and the most serious manifestation of gender-based discrimination, and women and girls with disabilities face unique challenges that heighten their vulnerability. In Albania, societal stigma and systemic discrimination are compounded by insufficient legal protections and a lack of accessible and tailored support services. Consequently, women and girls with disabilities are at increased risk of violence, underscoring the urgent need for targeted interventions. To effectively combat violence against women and girls with disabilities in Albania, it is crucial to effectively implement and enhance legal frameworks with specific provisions for this demographic, as well as implement nationwide awareness campaigns that utilize accessible materials to reduce stigma. Public services must be fully accessible, with dedicated funding allocated to organizations serving these women. Emergency response services must be meticulously structured to address the unique requirements of women with disabilities thereby guaranteeing their safety in times of crisis and facilitating access to prompt assistance. Technology must be used to enhance accessibility for women with disabilities, creating accessible reporting mechanisms for cases of violence, and developing digital tools for education and raising awareness.",220,True,False,True,False,0.0

According to the most recent census data, disability prevalence in Albania among individuals aged 5 and older is 6.5 percent. Among individuals with at least one disability, the majority were women (56 percent compared to men at 44 percent), highlighting the need for targeted policies that address the unique challenges faced by women with disabilities. Data from the 2018 National Survey on Violence Against Women and Girls revealed that 52.9 percent of women aged 18-74 experienced at least one form of violence, whether intimate partner violence, dating violence, non-partner violence, sexual harassment, or stalking, during their lifetime. Additionally, 36.6 percent of respondents reported experiencing one or more of these forms of violence in the 12 months prior to the survey.

Violence against women and girls with disabilities Women and girls with disabilities globally face all forms of gender-based violence. The World Health Organization reports that they are two to four times more likely to experience intimate partner violence compared to those without disabilities.3 A survey in Southeast and Eastern Europe revealed that women with disabilities report a higher lifetime prevalence of various forms of gender-based violence-including physical, sexual and psychological abuse-by various perpetrators. Both partner and non-partner violence, as well as sexual harassment, are notably more prevalent among this group.4 The recent UN published Flagship Report on Disability and Development indicates that women and girls with disabilities are at particular risk of sexual violence, with 8 per cent of women with disabilities compared to 5 per cent of women without disabilities having suffered sexual violence in the last 12 months.

Sexual violence - engaging in non-consensual acts of a sexual nature with another person through coercion, threats or exploitation of vulnerability, irrespective of the relationship between the perpetrator and the victim, often exploiting the victim’s vulnerabilities and dependence. It encompasses rape and any other non-consensual sexual activity. Sexual harassment - unwanted physical contact, inappropriate comments and various forms of non- physical harassment, including stalking and suggestive behavior.

Obstetric violence - unnecessary medical interventions during childbirth, disproportionately affecting women with disabilities. Institutional violence - neglect, abuse and systemic violations of a person’s rights in care facilities, often exacerbated by inadequate responses from authorities. Forced institutionalization is also a significant concern, particularly for women with intellectual or psychosocial disabilities. Violence against women and girls with disabilities in Albania Stigma and stereotypes surrounding women and girls with disabilities7 are deeply rooted in Albanian cultural and traditional norms. Traditional views and cultural attitudes often consider disability as a shameful or negative trait, which leads to social isolation for women with disabilities.

Women with disabilities also often face significant barriers in education and employment due to negative stereotypes about their capabilities, which can perpetuate cycles of poverty and dependency. Main forms of violence. Surveys by specialized CSOs8 in Albania indicate that women and girls with disabilities face various forms of violence. Those with intellectual disabilities and mental health conditions are particularly vulnerable due to difficulties in recognizing and reporting abuse. Women with physical, visual or speech disabilities often experience psychological and physical violence linked to caregiver dependency, compounded by societal prejudices that result in passive violence affecting their mental health. Common forms of abuse include withholding medication, home isolation due to broken mobility aids. Emotional violence, such as household members threatening to abandon those in wheelchairs or the possibility of institutionalization for girls with disabilities, illustrates the profound impact of emotional abuse in this context. Women with moderate or severe intellectual disabilities and mental health challenges are particularly vulnerable to sexual violence, human trafficking, prostitution and begging since their conditions can increase their risk of exploitation.

Risk assessment prior to issuing a protection order is considered a fundamental step and is included in the primary and secondary (orders, instruction, etc.) legislation provisions/ updated provisions. The preliminary protection order is issued by the State Police when the relevant risk assessment shows that the violence perpetrated amounts to a risk to the life, health and freedoms of the household members. This order is executed immediately and is reviewed within 48 hours by a competent court, which may decide to issue an emergency protection order. In addition to the above, one of the positive developments ushered in by amendments to this law in 2018, is the inclusion of violence from an intimate partner regardless of cohabitation arrangements, and the issuing of protection orders in these cases. 8 REPORT 3.

Gender equality remains a fundamental priority in Albania’s economic, political, and social development. While the country has made notable legislative advancements, persistent challenges continue to hinder progress, particularly in women’s economic participation, political representation, access to justice, protection from gender-based violence (GBV), participation in climate decision- making, digital literacy, etc. Strengthening institutional coordination, enforcement mechanisms, and resource allocation is critical to ensuring that Albania’s policies and legal frameworks result in meaningful improvements for women and girls. Purpose and Objectives The CGEP serves as a strategic tool for policymakers, EU institutions, international organizations, and civil society actors in monitoring gender equality trends and shaping future policies. The report aims to: • Assess Albania’s progress in achieving gender equality and women’s empowerment from 2020-2025. • Evaluate the effectiveness of national policies, legislation, and institutional mechanisms in advancing gender equality. • Identify key gender-based barriers to economic participation, political leadership, and social inclusion. • Analyze Albania’s alignment with EU directives and key international frameworks, including the Convention for Elimination of all Forms of Violence Against Women (CEDAW), the Universal Periodic Review (UPR), the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), and the Council of Europe Convention of Combatting Violence against Women and Domestic Violence (Istanbul Convention).",237,True,False,True,True,0.0

These commitments are further reflected in national priorities under the United Nations Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework (UNSDCF) 2022-2026, which integrates gender equality across governance, economic, and social development policies. Additionally, Albania’s EU accession process provides an opportunity to advance gender equality by aligning national policies with EU Gender Action Plan III (EU GAP III) 2021-2025, the EU acquis, and the new EU Roadmap for Women’s Rights, 2025. However, full alignment requires sustained political commitment, institutional capacity-building, and financial investment to integrate gender equality into legislation, labor policies, governance structures, and economic reforms. Scope and Methodology CGEP adopts a multi-dimensional methodology, combining both quantitative and qualitative analysis. The assessment is based on a detailed review of national legal and policy frameworks, EU accession requirements, and global commitments.

Their combined efforts have been essential to achieving these successes. Significant achievements include two transformative joint programmes financed by the Sustainable Development Goal Fund: Digital Agriculture and Rural Transformation (DART) and Lifelong Empowerment and Protection in Albania. Meanwhile, the country’s first National SDG Roadmap was successfully created, with other initiatives such as the Women Entrepreneurship Expo aiming to foster an inclusive business environment, with six companies joining the UN Global Compact and 38 pledging support for the Women’s Empowerment Principles. Our support for building the country’s human capital focuses on effectively implementing reforms in social care, education and healthcare. Albania’s participation in the Global Accelerator on Jobs and Social Protection for Just Transition underscores its commitment to advancing labour policies, social welfare and inclusive measures for vulnerable groups. Adoption of the Social Protection Strategy (2024-2030) and the Social Inclusion Policy (2024-2028) lays the foundation for enhanced services and the inclusion of vulnerable groups of the population.

Primary healthcare advancement, emergency preparedness and effective public +health management are central to Albania’s health strategy. A transparency portal and a GIS platform aim to improve planning and address infrastructure needs, while vaccination, child nutrition monitoring and emergency preparedness have been improved. Green growth and efforts to combat climate change have driven progress in climate-smart agriculture, vocational education and digital transformation. Employment and skills development initiatives reached thousands of individuals, while work on the green and blue economies saw gender integration in tourism, and the revitalization of Albania’s cultural heritage, with 18 cultural sites benefiting from restoration and upgraded facilities. Implementation of the groundbreaking DART aims to leverage digitalization to advance sustainability goals with systemic interventions aimed particularly at smallholder farmers. The country also advanced in fulfilling its commitments under the Montreal Protocol by implementing systems to phase out ozone-depleting substances and adopting low- global-warming technologies.

Gender equality in Albania has been supported by a robust legal framework and improvements in key indices. The country has made notable progress in advancing gender equality and addressing violence against women and children. Support from the UN enhanced services for survivors of domestic violence, trafficking and other forms of abuse, providing both immediate assistance and long-term empowerment for women and children from vulnerable groups. Gender- responsive budgeting has become an integral part of Albania’s financial planning. As a result, 59 per cent of budgetary programmes for 2025 now incorporate gender-specific objectives, driving more equitable resource distribution and policy implementation.

Shumë lloje të ndryshme të ndërhyrjeve janë cituar shpesh kur diskutohet se si jeta e njerëzve mund të përmirësohet. Në mënyrë tipike, këto janë masat në fushën e infrastrukturës, metodat e prodhimit, politikat (lidhur me tregtinë, bujqësia, etj), mjedisi, dhe kështu me radhë. Edukimi për të ushqyerit të shëndetshëm është vështirë të përfshihet në një listë të tillë. Ndër shtyllat e shumta që formojnë bazën e një kombi të lulëzuar, tre janë veçanërisht të të rëndësishme: ushqyerja, shëndeti dhe edukimi. Është pothuajse e vetëkuptueshme se shëndeti është i rëndësishëm për zhvillimin e një vendi. Ushqyerja e shëndetshme është një tjetër shtyllë e zhvillimit, dhe jo vetëm për shkak se ushqimi është nevojë më themelore e njeriut. Pa ushqimin e duhur, shëndeti është i pamundur. Sasia dhe llojet e ushqimeve që njerëzit hanë, dhe cilësia e siguria e tyre ushqyese, kanë efekt të drejtpërdrejtë në shëndetin e njerëzve dhe mirëqenien dhe kështu edhe në aftësinë e tyre për të vepruar. Edukimi, gjithashtu është shumë thelbësor për zhvillimin e një vendi.Edukimi krijon zgjedhje dhe mundësi për njerëzit, zvogëlon barrën e dyfishtë të varfërisë dhe sëmundjeve, dhe i jep një zë më të fortë të individëve në shoqëri.

Të tre faktorët janë të ndërlidhur ngushtë, dhe madje edhe të varur nga njëri-tjetri. Efektet pozitive të një faktori mund të arrihet vetëm nëse shoqërohen nga faktorë të tjerë. Pa shëndetin e duhur, për shembull, edukimi i mirë nuk është i mundur,por dhe pa edukimin e duhur, shëndeti vuan. Gjithashtu, ushqimi dhe edukimi janë të ndërlidhura ngushtë. Është e kuptueshme zakonisht se të ushqyerit e mirë gjatë fëmijërisë është i rëndësishëm për rritje të shëndetshme dhe zhvillim. Por, përveç që ndikojnë në rritjen fizike dhe në pjekurinë e tij, gjendja ushqyese e fëmijës ndikon edhe në një numër faktorësh të tjerë që janë qendrore për arritjet edukative të fëmijës - shëndet i mirë dhe ushqyerja e mirë rrit vëmendjen e fëmijës, kapacitetine të mësuarit, dhe aftësinë e tij të plotë për t’u angazhuar në përvojat e arsimore. Ushqimi i mirë është bazë për shëndet të mirë, dhe të dy ndihmojnë duke e bërë edukimin efektiv.

Realiteti në këto vende aktualisht sugjeron të kundërtën,për shumë arsye: Nivelet e larta të nënushqyerjes dhe defiçencave nutricionale (Defiçencat e vitaminës A dhe jodit, anemia ferro-defiçitare,e kështu me radhë) kërkojnë ndërhyrje urgjente. Sëmundjet kronike të lidhura me dietën,duke përfshirë peshën e tepruar dhe obezitetin,po rriten në vendet në zhvillim po aq shumë sa edhe në botën e zhvilluar. Vendet në zhvillim do ta kenë veçanërisht të vështirë të përballojnë ngarkesën e dyfishtë të sëmundjeve që vjen nga nënushqyerja si edhe nga dieta e tepruar dhe e pabalancuar. Zhvillimi ekonomik dhe njerëzor kërkon njerëz të shëndetshëm. Nivelet e larta të rritjes së popullatës prekin të tërë sistemin ushqimor të një vendi,kështu njerëzit kanë nevojë të mësojnë rreth kësaj dhe të përshtaten ndaj zhvillimeve të reja në sistem. Ekziston një migracion më i madh nga komunitetet rurale drejt mjediseve urbane, ku njerëzit varen tërësisht në furnizimin komercial/tregtar me ushqime. Si rezultat, prurjet e reja kërkojnë aftësi të reja për të zgjedhur dietat ushqimore. Zhvillimi ekonomik dhe globalizimi prezanton/sjell ushqime të reja, zakone dhe stile jetese të ndryshuara, duke i bërë njohuritë dhe aftësitë tradicionale të pamjaftueshme dhe të papërshtatshme.",243,False,False,False,False,0.0

Importantly, investment in early childhood education can drive progress within the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and be central to meet basic child rights enshrined in the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC). In Albania the importance and challenges of preschool education cannot be understated. Albania is faced with an ageing and shrinking population, which presents a concerted threat to the entity’s economic and social development. This demographic situation is the result of both low birth rates and high rates of emigration. They must be the focus of urgent policy and investment attention. Early childhood development is particularly important given this demographic context. With fewer children and limited resources, Albania must cultivate since early age a skilled, productive young work force to sustain and improve economic and social conditions. Over the past fifteen years, progress has been made towards a conducive policy environment for the preschool ecosystem. This includes the National Strategy of Education (2022-2026) which has a focus on preschool, the development of the National Curricula on preschool, The National Standards of Preschool Education etc.",245,True,False,True,True,0.0

This includes the National Strategy of Education (2022-2026) which has a focus on preschool, the development of the National Curricula on preschool, The National Standards of Preschool Education etc. However, there are clear untapped opportunities to invest in Albania’s younger generations. The conditions needed for the young children to thrive, and meet their full potential are not fully in place. Funding for preschool has been generally inadequate to meet needs. Further, often figures hide significant inequities in outcome between groups of young children, with Roma children, children with disabilities (CwD), children from rural or low-income backgrounds, all facing additional challenges. In Albania, there are currently about 79,000 children benefiting from the pre-school education service in about 2,000 public and private kindergartens. There are about 4,800 teachers employed in the pre-school service in 61 municipalities (average 2019-2021)1.

The Methodology of Assignment The focus of the study has been on analysing spending on the pre-school education by looking at the local government budget programing and allocations of financial resources for financing the pre-school education municipal services. The analyses covered the period 2017 - 2022 with a deeper dive in two municipalities, Municipality of Elbasan and Municipality of Lushnje.

Main Findings The new Territorial and Administrative reform (TAR) and decentralisation of functions ensured a better allocation of funds for pre-school education, with a gradual transition that minimized costs. Since 2019, financing of the pre-school education is covered through the Unconditional Sectorial Transfers from the central government to local government. Overall, preschool education amounts about 11-12% of municipal expenditures for pre-university education and about 16% of expenditures for basic education. Government transfer for preschool education is calculated based on a formula considering: 40% on the number of teachers employed in preschool education and 60% the number of pupils enrolled. Municipalities have the freedom to decide how they allocate and spend the transfer earmarked on preschool education function. Despite the positive effects of the reform, there is still a substantial gap on funding this function. Most of local government units still rely to a large part on national transfers to finance preschool education. The size of unconditional sectorial transfer for preschool education allocated to the municipalities is considered insufficient to allow municipalities to properly deliver this function.

Pre-school education expenditures equalled 20.5% of municipal own source revenues in 2023, which declined by 1.9% compared to 2017. Central Government unconditional sectorial transfer for preschool education has increased steadily since the TAR and Decentralisation reform, but its ratio vs Gross Domestic Product (GDP) has not changed. In 2023 the sectorial transfer for preschool education was 5.9 billion ALL, which is increased by 50.9%. compared to 2016 (the first year of TAR that the function was transferred to local government). During 2016-2023, specific transfer for preschool education to local government, amounted to 0.29% of the GDP. Despite GDP increased in 2023 by 40% compared to 2017, the specific transfer ratio compared to GDP has remained almost the same as 2017: only 0.27% of the Albania’s GDP. While overall local government budget and spending has increased, this has not been reflected proportionally on spending related to preschool education. Over the period 2017-2023 the sectoral transfer for preschool education was in average about 9.3% of the total local government budget.

Local governments unite that have limited revenues from their own sources, may be less capable to provide adequate funds for pre-school education, leading to inequality in access and quality of early childhood education. The level of spending per child on pre-school education across municipalities has significant discrepancies. Some municipalities such as Shijak, Fushë-Arrëz, or Pukë have a relatively high level of spending for children in pre-school education during 2021, respectively at the levels of 909 thousand ALL, 251 thousand ALL, and 204 ""Policy options for Early Childhood Education Financing"" in Albania.” Page 6 / 72 thousand ALL. It is noted that municipalities with a higher concentration of population, such as Lezha, Korça, and Kurbini, show a relatively lower levels of spending per child on pre-school education. Albania`s spending on preschool education is much lower compared to EU or OECD. Spending on preschool education in Albania makes 0.29% of GDP, compared to average 4.9% of EU countries and 0.8% of OECD average.

Recent Population Census data shows that among those with tertiary education, 55.7 percent are women and 44.3 percent are men. The proportion of women with tertiary education completed continuously increased from 41.1 percent in the 2001 Census to 51.0 percent in the 2011 Census, and 55.7 percent in 2023 Census.

The fields of study most pursued by girls are education (82.6 percent of girl graduates), health and wellbeing (78.1 percent girl graduates), and human sciences (78.4 percent of girl graduates).1 Even though more women graduate from university compared to men, they do not enter the labor force in the same numbers and not in line with their professional qualification.2 Over- qualification has become more prevalent in recent years. Working in a job that has lower educational requirements than one’s own education level is associated with a ‘wage penalty’, which has been shown to be higher for women than men.3 The overall rate for Youth not in Employment, Education or Training (NEET) in 2023 is 24.6 percent - the highest in Europe.

In terms of labour market activity, young men are more engaged, with 60.1% actively seeking work and available for employment, compared to 39% of NEET women. A significant share of NEET women is engaged in unpaid domestic work and family care, with one in four (25.3%) dedicating their time to household responsibilities, compared to just 0.2% of NEET men. Gender differences in NEET rates are compounded by residence. In rural areas, NEET rates are 2.0 percentage points higher for young women, while in urban areas, rates are 3.5 percent higher for young men.4 Most students in vocational education are boys, accounting for about 84 percent of enrollments. Underlying reasons are the common mentality regarding so-called “male professions”, the social climate in vocational schools, the type of curricula offered, and girls’ employment perspectives upon graduation.

A few highlights are provided below along possible policy avenues: - Albania is faced with a shrinking school- age population, which is putting pressure on its ability to operate an efficient system while guaranteeing quality education for everyone. This is further compounded by internal migration towards urban centres and external migration of families and young graduates. Strengthening school mapping and school rationalization pro­ cesses to keep unit costs under control in the face of a declining school-age population would be needed. - The Roma and Egyptian communities (which face various socio-economic and linguistic challenges) continue to exhibit some of the highest drop-out rates and lower learning outcomes despite effort to support them.

In this regard, the information and communications technology (ICT) sector has been identi­ fied as a key priority area that can strengthen competencies of the future workforce and create new opportunities for employment. As such, a boost in teachers’ digital competencies would be needed, along with the provision of quality digital courses for students at vocational education and training (VET) schools and higher education institutions (HEIs). - Currently no systematic information is produced to inform job seekers or policy makers on prospective labour market needs. As the Albanian Qualifications Framework (AQF) is implemented, con­ solidated, and referenced with the EU, the accreditation process at all levels (VET and HEIs) must seek to strengthen the assessment of needs for skills in the labour market - a task that demands support for institutional and capacity development for the accreditation bodies. Collaboration between education or VET and business is also to be strengthened, to allow linking education policies with labour market demands more efficiently. - With the decentralization process initi­ ated in 2015, the management of the basic schools’ network is shared between the Ministry of Education and Sport (MES), which is mainly responsible for teachers and school supervision, and local governments, which oversee infrastructure and day-to-day operations of the schools.",245,True,False,True,False,0.0

Definition of Human Capital One of the founders of the concept of human capital, the Nobel winning scholar Gary Becker, considers human capital to be “the knowledge, information, ideas, skills, and health of individuals”2 (Becker [2002]. This definition takes a wider approach to human capital compared to what, e.g., the OECD3 proposes, focusing more its economic dimension when defining human capital as “the knowledge, skills, competencies and other attributes embodied in individuals that are relevant to economic activity”. In each case, human capital is considered to be a fundamental factor for economic prosperity.",199,True,False,True,False,0.0

In each case, human capital is considered to be a fundamental factor for economic prosperity. The World Bank in its 2017’s Human Capital Project uses a more complete definition of Human Capital, which is widely and commonly understood and agreed by development partners and many countries at all income levels: “Human capital consists of the knowledge, skills, and health that people accumulate throughout their lives, enabling them to realize their potential as productive members of society”4. Building on this foundation, Nobel Prize winner Theodore W. Schultz's seminal work provides additional depth to our understanding by identifying five key categories of human investment activities: (1) health facilities and services, (2) on-the-job training, (3) formal education, (4) adult study programs, and (5) migration to change job prospects. This framework emphasizes that people invest in themselves not for immediate consumption but with expectation of future gain, and such improvements amount to investment capital. Based on this work, Kevin McNamara describes human capital stocks to represent the existing skills and knowledge base of a workforce that supports a community's economic structure, while human capital flows refer to the rate at which new skills and knowledge are being added to this existing foundation through ongoing investments and development activities.",246,True,False,True,False,0.0

Thus, the concept of human capital emphasizes, at minimum, sustained investments in health, education, and the social protection of individuals, which align directly with protection from poverty (SDG1), quality education (SDG 4), good health and well-being (SDG 3), and decent work and economic growth (SDG 8). Recognizing the growing complexity and interconnectedness of the global economy and the broader set of attributes required for individuals to excel and flourish, as well as the need to accelerate human capital development in Albania, early childhood development, gender equality, and vocational training need to be in consideration when tackling with the wide-ranging issues of human capital development.",183,True,False,False,True,0.0

Several of the six transformative entry points or six key transitions the United Nations has identified for accelerating the SDGs (food systems; energy access and affordability; digital connectivity; education; jobs and social protection; and climate change, biodiversity loss and pollution) and to be discussed at the Summit of the Future in September 2024, are deeply intertwined with the development of human capital. For instance, the transition towards better educational systems is crucial. Enhanced education systems capable to deliver high-quality education for all children, starting from the early years, empower individuals with the skills, knowledge and dispositions necessary to successfully learn, innovate and adapt, which are critical for transitions in other areas such as digital connectivity and jobs and social protection. Similarly, the focus on jobs and social protection is vital; by ensuring meaningful employment and social safety nets, particularly for the most marginalized, societies nurture human capital by enabling individuals to invest in their education and health without the looming threat of economic insecurity.",233,True,False,True,False,0.0

Such a comprehensive approach through key transitions, which account for synergies and tradeoffs, ensures a more resilient workforce ready to tackle the challenges presented by other transitions, including those related to climate change, energy access, and food systems. Therefore, fostering human capital supports broader systemic changes required for sustainable development.

Poverty and social exclusion disproportionately affect vulnerable groups in Albanian society, including women, children, youth, older persons, persons with disabilities, people with intermittent employment, and those in rural areas, but also marginalised groups such as Roma and Egyptian communities, and LGBTIQ+ individuals. These groups experience disproportionate poverty due to lack of education, social care services, housing, employment opportunities, and healthcare access, perpetuating a cycle of poverty across generations.

It holds a central position in the continuum of learning and development, contributing to enhanced intellectual and social-emotional growth in children. Extensive research has demonstrated that quality early childhood education, serves as a fundamental building block for promoting healthy development in young children. Despite the clear evidence on the importance of early childhood education, there has been a limited emphasis on this critical area within the broader landscape of educational investments and efforts. Given the significance of early childhood education, it is necessary to understand the context in which it takes place.",235,True,False,False,False,0.0

Given the significance of early childhood education, it is necessary to understand the context in which it takes place. Therefore, a research study to identify the supply side challenges related to access of ECE services in Albania, and related opportunities, was conducted. The study, driven by the commitment to support creating an enabling environment for quality education for every child, has a three-fold aim: i) to identify and present the supply side barriers related to access of ECE services in Albania; ii) inform policy and decision-making in support of design and implementation of policy programs and action in the area of early childhood education; iii) gain commitment and support alignment of action among education stakeholders to create and sustain change for quality education for all. A qualitative methodology, employing a descriptive phenomenological approach, was used for realization of this study, which was particularly important to explore new and complex topics surrounding ECE in Albania. The supply side barriers are described and explored as experienced from different actors within the education system, providing insights into the underlying factors and processes, and unexplored complex and nuanced phenomena.

The geographic scope of this study covered 4 sites, namely Berat, Dibra, Korça and Tirana. Key participating stakeholders were representatives of the main institutions related to ECEC (both central and local level), preschool teachers, directors and psychosocial staff, and parents of children attending and non - attending kindergarten. Study findings identify several factors impacting the provision of quality ECE services, which relate to: i) Accessibility - availability, accessibility, and affordability to access ECE services, ii) ECE workforce - teachers, assistant teachers, and psychosocial staff, their capacities and current practices, iii) Curriculum - curriculum content, teaching standards and practices, teaching and learning materials (TLM), iv) Monitoring and evaluation - operating procedures and implementation practices, and v) governance and funding - legal and policy framework, stakeholders’ roles, responsibilities, and collaboration, and funding sources. These highlight the crucial areas of focus that require concerted efforts to develop early childhood education (ECE) policies and programs, ultimately leading to the fulfillment of the commitment to provide educational opportunities for all.

This collaborative approach is vital for the effective design and delivery of early childhood policies and services. By working together, we can pave the way for a brighter future, where quality early childhood education becomes a reality for all children. Findings represent overarching patterns and trends observed across the four municipalities. They provide a comprehensive understanding of the common challenges, issues, and characteristics that exist in the overall landscape of early childhood education (ECE) in Albania. ACCESSIBILITY Although some positive practices exist to support accessibility to ECE, there is a need for more proactive efforts to encourage and enhance the provision of out-of-home educational care for young children. These efforts should prioritize several key aspects, including making ECE accessible and affordable for families from vulnerable contexts and children with special requirements, investing in proper physical infrastructure, ensuring an adequate supply of learning and teaching materials and resources, and supporting transportation services for children living in remote and distant areas contributing to improving access to ECE. • The number of available kindergarten facilities in some areas is insufficient to meet the demand for early childhood education.",239,True,False,False,False,0.0

This study examined the economic arguments concerning the fiscal effects i.e., investment of public funds in free universal childcare in Albania. The objectives are to: i) reduce gender inequality in employment, labour market activity and earnings; ii) to promote human capital through greater enrolment of children in early childhood learning and development; and iii) to ensure equal access to all children in formal childcare as to foster the life chances and well-being of children. These arguments are highlighted by computing the benefits and costs of such an investment. The study demonstrates that, under relatively cautious assumptions, the benefits significantly exceed the costs. Thus, publicly funded universal child care would represent a prudent and productive use of scarce public funds in Albania. In order to make such a case, two conditions must be met. First, benefits must exceed costs. The study looks at a comprehensive unpaid work of women and men versus public investment, providing to identify benefits. The study estimated the employment-generating and fiscal effects of investing in universal childcare in Albania.

It calculates the total annual costs of investing in childcare that would increase the enrolment (coverage) rate of the children in formal childcare to different target levels. There are several approaches for this analysis including current enrolment rate to target enrolment, however, the study used parameters relevant to the Albanian context. It concludes that for every dollar spent on such a program, approximately two dollars or more worth of benefits are generated for children and their parents (due to employment). The benefits to parents are somewhat identical. Child care frees up parents’ time to participate in the labour force, and this generates two relatively clear benefits. First, employed parents receive wages for that participation. Second, by continuing to be employed while children are young, parents are able to avoid extended absences from the workforce. These absences erode work skills in a variety of ways, and result in future reductions in earning power. Drawing on specific studies of these issues, a value can be assigned to the increases in employment permitted by a comprehensive child care. The benefits of child care are divided into the benefits to children, business society, and the benefits of employment to their parents. The analysis has focused on employment effects, as both types of benefits are critical to this analysis.",229,False,False,False,True,0.0

The study argues, however, that there is a significant public interest in universal childcare. For families in which parents are employed and those in which they are not, stimulating child care can have strong and long-lasting effects on parent’s employment and child development. And, for some families, good child care can permit parents to maintain job skills and continuous employment experience, with enduring effects on family incomes.",217,True,False,True,False,0.0

And, for some families, good child care can permit parents to maintain job skills and continuous employment experience, with enduring effects on family incomes. In summary, when all this is brought together, the incremental benefits of the identified changes to universal child care arrangements in Albania amount to approximately two dollars plus for every dollar of cost (in monetary terms) to the Government. Therefore, universal child care matters to children, to parents and to society. The benefits of such a program are likely to significantly outweigh the costs, and thus, publicly funded child care deserves a high priority when decisions on the allocation of scarce public funds are made.

Universal, affordable, high- quality child care is necessary to support parents, especially women and when it is not available, the situation is challenging, such as:  A lack of affordable childcare is frequently cited as one of the biggest barriers to women’s opportunities to work, limiting the type and amount of work in which they can engage in outside the home2.  A lack of childcare can limit productivity and the type of employment women can engage in, preventing women from taking more stable and lucrative opportunities3.  A number of studies and surveys have concluded that childcare allows for longer working hours, higher productivity and income, and employment in the formal, rather than informal, sector.  There is a strong correlation between mothers’ labor force participation and enrollment of children in childcare services4.  Evidence from a range of disciplines confirms that a child’s earliest years are a critical time to invest in building foundational skills.  The benefits of quality childcare and early learning settings include improved school readiness, reduced repetition and drop-out rates, and higher achievement in school5.",244,True,False,False,False,0.0

Albania has seen improvements in subsequent years, however, unemployment and poverty still threaten many Albanian households and continue to have a negative impact on the social status of women in the country. Data on poverty in Albania point to the feminisation of the phenomenon, and an increase in the number of poor children. In Albania, gender inequality represents a serious impediment to acceleration of poverty reduction. Addressing gender inequality plays a primary role in enhancing the well-being of thousands of Albanian children who live in poverty. 1. United Nations Children’s Fund. (2019).

KEY POLICY DEVELOPMENTS IN EDUCATION, TRAINING AND EMPLOYMENT - ALBANIA 2024 | 03 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY In 2023, Albania took significant steps to address longstanding challenges exacerbated by events such as the 2019 earthquake, the 2020 pandemic, and inflation driven by Russia's invasion of Ukraine. These crises severely impacted Albania's economy, labour market, and under-resourced education system. Despite these challenges, Albania achieved notable progress in education, vocational training, and employment policies. The launch of the National Employment and Skills Strategy (2023-2030) underscored Albania's commitment to addressing infrastructure needs, digitalisation, environmental sustainability, and enhancing the quality of vocational education and training (VET). The strategy emphasises lifelong learning, work-based learning, and civic engagement. The public employment services were reinforced, with training and active labour market measures expanded to support vulnerable groups better. Albania's employment landscape has recovered since the COVID-19 pandemic, with declining NEET (not in employment, education, or training) rates and moderate increases in employment and wages. While challenges persist, such as youth unemployment and job quality, the country is on a positive trajectory, bolstered by EU accession negotiations and significant foreign aid investments.",249,True,False,True,False,0.0

While challenges persist, such as youth unemployment and job quality, the country is on a positive trajectory, bolstered by EU accession negotiations and significant foreign aid investments. Demographic shifts, including rapid ageing and high emigration rates, pose significant challenges. Albania's population is ageing, with urbanisation concentrated in Tirana, while most regions face depopulation. The education system is struggling with declining enrolment, particularly in vocational education, and there is a critical need for lifelong learning initiatives to boost adult participation in education and training. Politically, Albania remains steadfast in its commitment to EU integration, with significant reforms in governance, justice, and anti-corruption efforts. The government has also prioritised investments in infrastructure, energy sustainability, and economic development to foster long-term recovery and growth. In conclusion, Albania has made substantial strides in reforming its education, training, and employment sectors. However, continued efforts are needed to address demographic challenges, expand vocational training and adult learning opportunities, and improve the overall quality and inclusiveness of education to ensure sustainable development.

He leads the government as prime minister in this parliamentary democracy until 2025. Notably, he has skilfully established himself as a key negotiator in the Serbia-Kosovo disputes throughout 2023 and is regularly quoted for his vocal and often constructive criticism of the EU accession process. The Albanian government has been primarily focused on two significant challenges: recovering from the November 2019 earthquake and addressing the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic while maintaining the momentum of ongoing reforms. Albania approved a record-breaking 2024 budget focused on fostering sustainable economic development, increasing investments in infrastructure, and expanding public welfare programmes. Significant allocations were made towards wage increases, educational support, and public infrastructure projects. In 2023, Albania focused on advancing its EU integration by implementing key reforms in governance and justice and strengthening its economic development through investments in infrastructure, tourism, and energy sustainability. Additionally, the government prioritised anti-corruption efforts and improved healthcare systems as part of its broader social and economic recovery strategy (EC 2023; IMF 2024).

The first intergovernmental conference occurred in July 2022. The European Commission submitted its screening report on Cluster 1 (Fundamentals) in July 2023, marking an essential step in accession negotiations. Additionally, Albania is aligning its national reforms with the EU's Growth Plan for the Western Balkans, which aims to accelerate socio-economic transformations, strengthen governance, and enhance digital and green transitions (European Commission 2024). An overwhelming 92% of Albanians view EU membership as a positive development, with 85% expressing the belief that their government should intensify efforts to strengthen relations with the EU. This level of support for EU integration consistently ranks among the highest in the region (RCC, 2023). Demographics The demographic landscape of Albania reveals several concerning trends. The number of births in the country only marginally offsets the combined effects of mortality and emigration rates. Consequently, the population is ageing rapidly, and its overall growth rate has hovered around zero for the past two decades. As of 2023 (the last estimates available), Albania's population stands at 2 771 785, reflecting a continued decline of approximately 1% compared to the previous year (INSTAT, 2024).

Approximately two-thirds of the population resides in urban centres, with Tirana hosting one-third of the total population. It is the sole prefecture in the country witnessing population growth (Betti et al., 2018; INSTAT, 2024). Albania contends with a notably high level of emigration, ranking among the top countries worldwide in terms of emigration as a percentage of the current population. Although emigration witnessed a temporary dip during the COVID-19 pandemic, historical data reveals a consistent upward trajectory in emigration across diverse socio-economic strata and educational backgrounds. Notably, the brain drain phenomenon, particularly among well-educated and highly skilled individuals in their twenties, predominantly targets destinations within the European Union and North America (ETF, 2021). Recent KEY POLICY DEVELOPMENTS IN EDUCATION, TRAINING AND EMPLOYMENT - ALBANIA 2024 | 05 surveys indicate that 49% of respondents expressed a desire to leave the country, with only Kosovo surpassing this number amongst the Western Balkans accession countries. One contributing factor to emigration is the perceived inadequacies of the Albanian education system.

Consequently, Albania boasts a notable presence among Western Balkan countries in terms of the number of students studying abroad. Interestingly, there has been a slight increase in returning emigrants, amounting to 5.9% from 2021 to 2022 (INSTAT, 2022). In the academic year 2023-2024, 533,711 pupils and students were enrolled in formal education, with a decrease of 3.7% compared to the academic year 2022-2023.

The services sector, particularly tourism and construction, and increased private consumption due to rising employment and wages have driven this growth (OECD 2024). Inflation remained moderate between 2019 and 2021 but spiked to 6.7% in 2022 due to Russia's war in Ukraine and surging global food and energy prices. By 2023, inflation eased to 4.3%; this downward trend is expected to continue, with Albania likely to achieve its 3% inflation target by early 2025 (IMF, 2024). In 2021, informality was estimated at 37% of the economy, highlighting the size of the grey market. While there have been efforts to combat informality, such as wage increases and employment growth, informality remains a significant obstacle (OECD, 2024). An older study revealed a notably high proportion of informal employment, constituting 56.7% of total employment, with agriculture (63.9%), wholesale and retail trade (12.6%), and construction (7.6%) being the most prevalent sectors in the informal economy (ILO 2020). INSTAT (2023) further documented that, in 2020, informal employment accounted for 34.1% of employment in the non-agricultural sector. The incidence of vulnerable employment has increased in Albania from 48.2% in 2021 to 49% in 2022 but decreased to 46.8% in 2023 (INSTAT, ETF calculations).

The recent rise in employment has not been accompanied by a corresponding increase in social insurance contributors, suggesting a possible expansion of informal employment (European Commission, 2023) Remittances sent to Albania in 2023 equated to 8.8% of its GDP, a slight decrease for a share hovering around 10% over a decade (INSTAT, 2024). Key social issues Although employment trends in Albania are positive, the labour market faces significant challenges. These include a lack of high-quality job opportunities, elevated youth unemployment and inactivity rates, and a substantial number of vulnerable individuals who remain outside the workforce. These difficulties strain citizens' mutual support systems and pressure the social welfare system. 'Making ends meet' measures a household's ability to cope financially.

Similarly, also in 2023, the rate for people who are 'at risk of poverty1'stood at 20.6% (INSTAT 2024), and the World Bank (2024) estimates the 'Upper middle-income poverty rate (USD 6.85)' is 34.2%. Inequality mainly affects the unemployed, low education attainment people, rural population, vulnerable women, persons with disabilities, and Roma and Egyptian minorities. The inequality in income distribution, as measured by the Gini coefficient, stood at 31% in 2022, a three-point decrease from 2019 (INSTAT, 2024). 1 The at-risk-of-poverty rate indicates the percentage of persons living in households where equivalent disposable income is below the at-risk-of-poverty threshold.

This reflects continuous improvement in key areas such as life expectancy, education, and income. While showing significant progress, Albania's HDI is still below the European average. It is competitive within the Western Balkans but has room for growth compared to higher-performing European nations (UNDP, 2024).

Over the past four years, Albania has undertaken institutional reforms and restructured key agencies responsible for educational support and external evaluation. These efforts aim to decentralise governance mechanisms and enhance service delivery. For instance, the Albanian Quality Assurance Agency (ASCAL) emerged from restructuring the Public Accreditation Agency for Higher Education (PAAHE).

These challenges include the aftermath of the 2019 earthquake, the impact of the 2020 pandemic and inflationary pressures resulting from Russia's invasion of Ukraine. These events have had profound effects on the Albanian economy, the labour market and the nation's capacity to fund its social initiatives, particularly within an under-funded education system with declining participation rates. Despite these formidable obstacles, notable accomplishments have been achieved in 2023. Building upon the successes of the previous national strategy, which encompassed a comprehensive renewal of the vocational education and training (VET) legal framework, the approval of the Albanian referencing report to the European Qualification Framework (EQF) and the establishment of two sector skills councils, Albania introduced the new National Employment and Skills Strategy (2023- 2030) in response to the multifaceted impacts experienced.",233,True,False,True,False,0.0

This strategy addresses infrastructure, digitalisation, environmental sustainability, VET quality, lifelong learning, work-based learning (WBL) and civil society engagement. Additional developments include the reinforcement of public employment services with updated service guidelines and relevant training. Active labour market measures have been expanded and diversified to cater to the needs of hard-to-reach vulnerable groups and to support apprenticeship programmes. With substantial donor support, the Ministry of Finance and relevant institutions have identified needs and formulated a National Implementation Plan for the Youth Guarantee. This initiative will undergo a pilot phase in three regions before being scaled up nationwide. Albania's employment situation has seen improvements since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, although it has not fully returned to pre-pandemic levels.

KEY POLITICAL, DEMOGRAPHIC, ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL CHARACTERISTICS Political developments 'The current Prime Minister, Edi Rama, regarded as pro-European by most observers, secured his third consecutive victory in the parliamentary elections held in April 2021. It is highly likely that he will continue to lead the government in this parliamentary democracy until 2025. Notably, he has skilfully established himself as a key negotiator in the Serbia-Kosovo disputes throughout 2023. The Albanian government has been primarily focused on two major challenges: recovering from the November 2019 earthquake and addressing the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic while maintaining the momentum of ongoing reforms.

The first intergovernmental conference occurred in July 2022. In 2023, several bilateral meetings between the European Commission (EC) and Albania have been conducted to assess progress in aligning with the EU acquis. An overwhelming 92 % of Albanians view EU membership as a positive development, with 85 % expressing the belief that their government should intensify efforts to strengthen relations with the EU. This level of support for EU integration consistently ranks among the highest in the region (RCC, 2023).' Demographics The demographic landscape of Albania reveals several concerning trends. The number of births in the country only marginally offsets the combined effects of mortality and emigration rates. Consequently, the population is undergoing rapid aging, and its overall growth rate has hovered around zero for the past two decades. As of 2023, Albania's estimated population stands at 2 771 785, reflecting a continued decline of approximately 1% compared to the previous year (INSTAT, 2023). Depopulation has emerged as a pressing issue across most regions of Albania, while Tirana, the capital, experiences significant urbanisation. Approximately two thirds of the population resides in urban centres, with Tirana hosting one third of the total population. It is the sole prefecture in the country witnessing population growth (Betti et al., 2018; INSTAT, 2023).",232,True,True,True,False,0.0

It is the sole prefecture in the country witnessing population growth (Betti et al., 2018; INSTAT, 2023). In January 2023, the youth dependency ratio (ratio of the number of persons under working age 0-14 with the number of persons of working age 15 to 64) has decreased compared to January 2022: from 24.0 % to 23.8 %, while the old dependency ratio (ratio of the number of persons above the working age 65+ with the number of persons of working age 15 to 64) has increased: from 23.1 % to 24.4 % during the same period. (INSTAT, 2023). Albania contends with a notably high level of emigration, ranking among the top countries worldwide in terms of emigration as a percentage of the current population. Although emigration witnessed a temporary dip during the COVID-19 pandemic, historical data reveals a consistent upward trajectory in emigration across diverse socioeconomic strata and educational backgrounds. Notably, the brain drain phenomenon, particularly among well-educated and highly skilled individuals in their twenties, predominantly targets destinations within the European Union and North America (ETF, 2021a). Recent surveys indicate that 49 % of respondents expressed a desire to leave the country (RCC, 2023). One contributing factor to emigration is the perceived inadequacies of the Albanian education system.

Consequently, Albania boasts a notable presence among Western Balkan countries regarding the number of students studying abroad. Interestingly, there has been a slight increase in the number of returning emigrants, amounting to 5.9 % from 2021 to 2022 (INSTAT, 2022). KEY POLICY DEVELOPMENTS IN EDUCATION, TRAINING AND EMPLOYMENT - ALBANIA 2023 | 05 Moreover, in the academic year 2022/23, formal education in Albania recorded a decline in enrolment, with 554 222 pupils and students, marking a 4.3 % decrease compared to the previous year and a more significant 13.5 % decrease compared to the 2018/19 school year. This decline across all education levels has far-reaching implications for educational institutions and workforce planning within the education sector (INSTAT, 2023). Key economic developments The European energy and food crisis stemming from Russia's war against Ukraine has added significant strain to the Albanian economy, primarily composed of micro-enterprises with fewer than 10 employees. In 2020, SMEs accounted for 99.8 % of all enterprises and employed 81.9 % of Albania's workforce, predominantly operating in trade, accommodation and food services - the sectors hardest hit by the pandemic.

However, prompt and resolute government and central bank interventions mitigated pandemic-related adversities, maintaining macroeconomic and financial sector stability (OECD, 2022). Albania's GDP exhibited a 4.8 % growth in 2022, attributed to robust consumer demand, increased tourism and heightened construction activities. Most recently, the GDP in the second quarter of 2023 has increased by 3.23 % compared with the second quarter of 2022. The three branches that gave the highest positive contribution are: construction (+1.43 pp), real estate (+0.72 pp), and public administration, education and health (+0.66 pp). A survey (Williams, 2020) disclosed that 44.7 % of businesses reported competing with unregistered or informal counterparts. Another study revealed a notably high proportion of informal employment, constituting 56.7 % of total employment, with agriculture (63.9 %), wholesale & retail trade (12.6 %), and construction (7.6 %) being the most prevalent sectors in the informal economy (ILO 2020). INSTAT (2023) further documented that, in 2020, informal employment accounted for 34.1 % of employment in the non-agricultural sector. The incidence of vulnerable employment has increased in Albania from 48.2 % in 2021 to 49 % in 2022, a very worrying figure, as half of the employed population works in precarious and informal jobs.

Key social issues Despite favourable employment trends, labour markets in Albania are grappling with inherent structural difficulties. A deficiency in high-quality employment opportunities, along with elevated rates of youth and prolonged unemployment or inactivity, coupled with a substantial portion of vulnerable individuals remaining outside the workforce, exerts a considerable strain on citizens' mutual support capabilities and places significant stress on the social welfare system. 'Making ends meet' measures a household's ability to cope financially. Eurofund conducted a survey in 2021 and found that Albania has the highest rate in geographical Europe of citizens who claim to have 'difficulty making ends meet' at 69 %, which is more than twice the EU27 average (Eurofund 2022). Similarly, also in 2021, the rate for people who are 'at risk of poverty' stood at 22 % (INSTAT 2023). According to World Bank estimates, the 'national poverty rate' is 23.4 %, representing a continuous improvement from previous years (World Bank, 2022).

EDUCATION AND TRAINING 2.1 Trends and challenges Albania, once among the lowest-performing countries in the Western Balkans, has undergone a remarkable transformation over the past two decades. It has made substantial strides in enhancing access to education and elevating learning outcomes. During this period, there has been an increase of 2.3 years in the average duration of schooling, and the expected duration of schooling has risen by 3.1 years. In 2021, Albania achieved a Human Development Index (HDI) of 0.796, classifying it as a country with high human development and placing it 67th out of 191 nations. Nevertheless, it remains the second lowest in Europe, above only Bosnia and Herzegovina. However, when accounting for inequality, Albania ascends to the 50th position (UNDP, 2022).

Significant developments in 2023 include the commencement of Chapter 26 in Albania's EU accession negotiations and a notable modification to the Law on Pre-University Education, poised for parliamentary approval, which extends compulsory education. In 2022, Albania introduced its new education policy, effective until 2026, with a focus on enhancing teacher development, fostering inclusivity and upgrading ICT infrastructure. Over the past four years, Albania has undertaken institutional reforms and restructured key agencies responsible for educational support and external evaluation. These efforts aim to decentralise governance mechanisms and enhance service delivery. For instance, the Albanian Quality Assurance Agency (known as ASCAL) emerged from the restructuring of the Public Accreditation Agency for Higher Education (PAAHE). ASCAL is the sole institution in the higher education sector entrusted with monitoring and evaluating the quality of higher education. Additional recent advancements encompass the gradual introduction of competency-based curricula across various subjects and grade levels in basic education, the establishment of teacher training standards, and the implementation of a school evaluation indicator framework. Education strategy and legal framework for education Recent initiatives have encompassed the formulation of the new National Education Strategy and Action Plan spanning from 2021 to 2026.

In the same time it aims to offer more autonomy for higher education institutions so that they can increase ownership in decision making relating the opening of new study programmes. Another key element of the reform is the profiling of higher education institutes in order to assist students to be more prepared in the facing of the challenges of the labor market. The process of accreditation will be approximated even more with the standards of EU member states in this regard while Albania is preparing to request full membership in ENQA.The document focuses also on internationalization of universities by means of opening new campuses and increasing cooperation with the best European Universities.

However, there is little evidence of either an increase in reporting of VAC or a decrease in the level of violence itself, particularly within the home. Aims and objectives To better understand the dynamics of the current situation with regard to VAC, and the apparent lack of change in behaviour and practices, UNICEF Albania, with support from the Embassy of Sweden, commissioned a Knowledge, Attitudes and Practices (KAP) study of adults towards violence against children. The study had three discrete aims, as follows: • To determine the knowledge among adults of what constitutes VAC. • To determine how adults understand their legal responsibilities vis-à-vis witnessing, or practising VAC, or both. • To explore perceptions on the prevalence of VAC in Albania’s communities. The specific objectives of the study comprised the following: • To determine knowledge of what constitutes the various forms of VAC, across all domains - home, school, community and online - and including all forms of violence within and across these domains. • To assess the extent to which adults understand the intersectional nature of different forms of VAC.",233,True,False,True,False,0.0

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 1.201 aduls (aged 18-64) interviewed THE REPORTING OF VIOLENCE AGAINST CHILDREN IN ALBANIA EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 9 Key findings Many adults feel that their communities are unsafe for children, whether when walk- ing in their neighbourhoods or even at home, after dark, while their perceptions of safety for adults in the community are generally at a higher level than for children. The majority of adults in Albania do not think that VAC or domestic violence is common in the country. However, a substantial percentage acknowledge that it occurs, or is even very common. When asked specifically about how common specific forms of VAC are, more adults tend to think they are common or even very common. In all, 27 percent felt that harsh or physical punishment of children was very common, with another 67 percent thinking it does occur. Meanwhile, 60 percent believe cyberbullying is widespread and 57 percent that school bullying is very common.",224,True,False,False,False,0.0

These findings suggest that adults are more aware of specific types of violence that children experience, but may not always consider them as violent acts that are included in the definition of VAC. When asked about specific forms of sexual VAC, the majority of adults reported that they think sexual abuse of children, sexual harassment, stalking of girls and the sexual abuse of children by other children is either common or very common. Such perceptions have been largely informed by indirect experience or exposure to infor- mation in the public domain rather than by direct personal experience of different forms of violence. Nevertheless, adults were more likely to report personal knowledge of child maltreatment or neglect in their community than they are of the other forms of violence. Perceptions and experiences among adults of both domestic violence and VAC, and feelings of safety in the community and at home, are likely to impact the attitudes of adults in the country towards the various forms of VAC, as well as different practices and behaviours, including reporting, within the community and within homes and families.

Macroeconomic policy, including fiscal and monetary policy, is often thought of as gender friendly. However, insufficient social spending on the protection of women’s unpaid household labour not only hinders women’s employment, but also negatively affects child development. To date, macroeconomic policies in Albania have paid scant attention to these issues and have therefore not been conducive to the achievement of gender equality. Participation and consultation are still limited when it comes to the gender-responsive allocation of funds for social protection in the country’s budget. The priorities of women, especially unpaid care and children’s lifelong development, are not fully reflected in the way finances are actually allocated and used. Care activities enhance people’s physical and emotional well-being. The current distribution of unpaid care work in Albania is amazingly unequal, falling mainly on women and girls. Despite its importance, this work continues to lack visibility and is disregarded in the design of economic and social policies in Albania.

Introduction Albania is divided in many ways. Wealth, education, urban and rural habitat, sex, age, family-based groups, political affiliations, ethnicity and other criteria differentiate Albanians. The access of individuals and groups to economic, social and political re- sources is deeply unequal. Attention and support are required to facilitate the inclusion of specific populations: the marginalized and vulnerable, the poor, and, as important parts of these groups, the Roma and Egyptians and persons with disabilities. Gender inequality is one of the greatest challenges facing Albanian policymakers trying to achieve faster, more sustainable, and more inclusive growth.

Gender budgeting has enjoyed continued support for the past several years. Also, there are visible efforts from civil society to provide expert gender analysis and to broaden the debate on fiscal policy by demonstrating that gender budgeting contributes to good outcomes for women and children, especially the social and economic benefits of women’s equality and economic empowerment. However, spending on gender equality in Albania is modest at 0.05 per cent of its GDP. • In Albania, the distribution of care responsibilities is incredibly unequal, falling mainly on households and being carried out mostly by women as unpaid work. • Unpaid work accounts for roughly 60% of GDP in Albania1. The value of this labour is US$84 (EUR 71) based on an average monthly salary of US$390 (EUR 330), and taking into consideration that 35% of the approx- imate 1.08 million women in Albania are employed, this equates to the Albanian economy missing out on a potential US$ 32 (EUR 27) million every single month2. A staggering US$ 385 (EUR 324) million a year. • Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, women dedicated substantially more hours (21.74% of the day) than men to unpaid work. • Informal employment accounts for about 61% of total employment in Albania. • Despite its importance, this work continues to lack visibility and is underestimated and disregarded in the design of macroeconomic and social policies.",249,True,True,False,False,0.0

Albania’s social care and protection systems insufficiently defend people against poverty shocks and struggle to help women and girls find sustainably productive pathways. Investments in education, health care and social protection as a share of GDP are below EU averages. 1. IMF Working Paper 2019. 2. Ibid.

ILO Recommendation No. 202 urges countries to commit to four basic guarantees: • Access to essential health care, including maternity care; • Basic income security for children (e.g., family allowances); • Basic income security for persons of active age who are unable to earn sufficient income (e.g., due to sickness, unemployment, maternity or disability); • Basic income security for older persons. Though Albania has progressed in terms of social protection, further strides must be made in relation to gen- der equality and children’s rights. A relative lack of funding has resulted in the poor availability and quality of public social services and low levels of social protection benefits.

Key findings Public investment in care sectors can create and support job creation in both the care sector and in the wid- er economy as care workers expand their consumption. In Albania, there is a potential to expand thousand jobs (child care, and home health cares) by every 10 million EURO) public investment in a care infrastructure. However, future economic research is needed to quantify the effect of increased caregiving because of public investment. Investing in care work including child care would catalyze multiple positive effects: stabilizing care for women households (parents) - predominantly mothers - in the paid labor force who have been deeply impacted by the sudden lack of child care; ensuring employment stability for the critical child care workforce; and creating employment opportunities for unpaid women. Investing in a social care infrastructure is unambiguously an urgent national priority.

This analysis finds that a public investment in care sectors can support millions of jobs in paid care work and beyond. A robust investment in care would have important knock-on effects, including creating additional indirect jobs in related sectors for women and girls. 8 FINANCING A SOCIAL PROTECTION FLOOR FOR VULNERABLE WOMEN, GIRLS AND CHILDREN IN ALBANIA POLICY BRIEF Social protection financing, gender equality and expenditure In Albania, social protection spending is significantly lower than the EU average, although it more than dou- bled between 2005 and 2016. In 2016, Albania spent 9.4 per cent of its GDP on social protection, which is much lower than the European average of 28 per cent. Expenditure in the sector is dominated by social in- surance outlays, which account on average for over 75 per cent of total spending, and non-contributory cash programmes targeting poverty and disability. The social protection system provides coverage to almost half of the population. Spending levels, however, remain low due to the very modest size of pensions and poverty cash benefits. Government revenue finances more than half of social protection spending. The fiscal revenue structure relies heavily on indirect consumption taxes. The Albanian fiscal system has contributed to reducing inequalities; however, moderate poverty exists.",246,True,False,True,False,0.0

The Albanian fiscal system has contributed to reducing inequalities; however, moderate poverty exists. In Albania, as in other countries, women and men tend to have different economic roles and responsibilities. Also, their access to productive resources is different. As a result, in most cases, women are at a disadvan- tage. For example, women are usually expected to take on the bulk of caring for their families. This means that women (much more than men) have the double burden of performing both paid and unpaid work. This dual role often undermines women’s access to the paid labour market and other economic opportunities. In addition, it means they can only access a limited range of sectors and occupations. This double burden is also likely to make women more vulnerable within their own households, leading to negative effects on children and their development. This situation has been exacerbated by shocks like the COVID-19 pandemic. Weaknesses in the effectiveness of gender-sensitive public expenditure can be observed in funding allocation and policy decisions, including the amount of budget share earmarked for gender equality associated with issues like unpaid care work. In particular, Albania’s gender budgeting has not been able to stimulate the adoption of policy changes to improve care systems, including those for child development, specifically in the areas of: • Education, • The labour market to address unpaid care work, • Income inequality, • Welfare, • Childcare and family care, and • Health.",249,True,False,False,False,0.0

The way that governments raise, allocate and spend money to address universal care systems can reduce or amplify these gender-based inequalities. Gender budgeting is a strategy to promote economic growth, inclusive development and the equal realization of human rights.

Finding fiscal space for critical economic and social investment is necessary to achieve the sustainable development of children and women. As unpaid care work is pervasive in Albania and became more widespread during the pandemic, there is a real need to invest in and promote gender equality to safeguard the rights of women and girls. Gender-sensitive social protection can address such inequalities and enhance children’s well-being and development by: a) recognizing, reducing and redistributing women’s care work, b) expanding gender-responsive services to reduce care burdens and increase employment oppor- tunities and c) increasing men’s contribution to unpaid care",225,True,False,False,True,0.0

Women’s economic empowerment is key for growth both through the direct impact of the size of the labor force on output and the impact on productivity (Cuberes and Teignier 2016) and through higher domestic demand. In addition, the International Labour Organization estimates that reducing the gender gap in labour market participation by 25% could boost global GDP 3.9 % (ILO 2017). Fiscal policy is a powerful tool to close gender gaps. In advanced economies, childcare subsidies, paid parental leave, and a shift from household to individual tax filing have been used to encourage female labor force participation (Andresen and Havnes 2019; Bick and Fuchs-Schündeln 2017; Gelbach 2002; Kalb 2018; Christiansen and others 2016b, c). In developing economies, investing in female education and in infrastructure (including electricity, roads, water and sanitation) that reduces the time women spend on household production has yielded positive results in terms of female labor force participation (Cubas 2016; Dinkelman 2011; Ilahi and Grimard 2000; Jain Chandra and others 2018). Cash transfers are also shown to have a positive effect on female labor force participation1. 1.1 Methodology The country analysis on expenditures and fiscal space including gender and child sensitive budgeting (public expenditure) in Albania is a qualitative study completed using the data from labour force surveys, published reports and COVID-19 assessment report, other equivalent survey reports, administrative information, and household survey data, and in close collaboration with the Ministry of Finance and Economy and the INSTAT.",250,True,True,True,False,0.0

This provides essential information for policymakers that intends to adopt gender sensitive fiscal policy measures to empower women economically and, at the same time, tackle other economic and social priorities. Data analysis The report covers a wide array of subjects and provides comprehensive information on the socioeconomic status vis-à-vis public expenditure of Albania. This analysis builds a profile of the status of gender centered poverty and vulnerability in Albania based on their unpaid care and builds a profile of the status of gender centered poverty and vulnerability. The analysis discusses income and non-income dimensions of well-being in Albania. While the focus is to understand the situation of the least well-off sections of the population (gender based and children), the analysis provides valuable information on the overall level of wealth and wellbeing for the whole of Albania. The analysis presents poverty and inequality figures at the national level because of the unpaid care work. 8 EXPENDITURES AND FISCAL SPACE ANALYSIS INCLUDING GENDER AND CHILD SENSITIVE BUDGETING IN ALBANIA 2.

Gender and child sensitive socio-economic vulnerabilities in Albania Albania is an upper middle-income country. Albania’s economy grew by an average of 2.4 % over the past decade. The economy is dominated by the services sector, especially tourism, followed by agriculture, industry and construction. According to the Human Development Report 2019, Albania ranks 69th out of 189 countries and territories, with a Human Development Index (HDI) of 0.791. Despite the progress made, Albania is still one of the poorest countries in Europe, with an at-risk-of poverty rate of 23.4 % in 2018 (average of EU 28 countries, 16.9%). The national minimum wage is US$ 232 and the average, US$ 470 (31% of the EU average). Vulnerability, inequality, and social services In Albania, almost 40% of households are materially deprived, and 23.4% of the population is at risk of poverty2. Many regions and groups, such as Roma and Egyptians, have limited access to infrastructure. Family responsibilities, and lack of access to child care prevent women’s equal participation in the formal labour market. While many promising social protection reforms have recently been undertaken, social assistance benefits are too modest and not integrated with care services.

The Gender Equality Index in the Republic of Albania scores 60.4 points and it is seven points lower than EU-28 average. Albania’s Gender Equality Indices indicate that 51.1 % of women are engaged in caring for children or grandchildren, older people or people with disabilities every day, in comparison with 24.6 % of men.3 However, Gender Equality Index shows that one of the important structural inequality is related to the gender segregation both in the domains of knowledge and work. 2.1 Poverty Though Albania has not announced an official poverty line hence the measurement of poverty has not been consistent over time due to the recent change of the definition of poverty. Table 1 summarizes the poverty situation in Albania based on the Income and Living Conditions Survey in 2017, 2018 and 2019. It indicates the percentage of persons living in households where equivalent disposable income is below the at-risk-of- poverty threshold. The at-risk-of-poverty threshold is defined as 60 % of the median equivalized disposable income and adjusted by the equivalent scale of household structure4. 2. OECD 2019. 3.

The World Bank in its 2017’s Human Capital Project uses a more complete definition of Human Capital, which is widely and commonly understood and agreed by development partners and many countries at all income levels: “Human capital consists of the knowledge, skills, and health that people accumulate throughout their lives, enabling them to realize their potential as productive members of society”.",218,True,False,True,False,0.0

Thus, the concept of human capital emphasizes investments in health, education, and the social protection of individuals, which align directly with achieving quality education (SDG 4), good health and well-being (SDG 3), gender equality (SDG 5), and decent work and economic growth (SDG 8). The accumulation of human capital is the result of intentional and cumulative investments made by governments and households to support individuals to become healthy and productive members of society.

Several of the six transformative entry points or six key transitions identified for accelerating the SDGs (food systems; energy access and affordability; digital connectivity; education; jobs and social protection; and climate change, biodiversity loss and pollution) and to be discussed at the Summit of the Future in September 2024, are deeply intertwined with the development of human capital. For instance, the transition towards better and more inclusive educational systems is crucial. Enhanced education systems empower individuals with the skills and knowledge necessary to innovate and adapt, which are critical for transitions in other areas such as continuous technological innovation (digital transformation and artificial intelligence), jobs and social protection. Similarly, the focus on jobs and social protection is vital; by ensuring meaningful employment and social safety nets, societies nurture human capital by enabling individuals to invest in their education and health without the looming threat of economic insecurity.

The future of work, in particular a just and green transition, will require governments to facilitate the adaptation to sustainable practices and new technologies. The emerging sector of green jobs, crucial for mitigating climate change and ensuring a path to environmental sustainability, further underscores the critical role of STEM expertise. Despite the increasing demand for skilled professionals in these areas, a significant gender gap still persists, with women and girls markedly underrepresented in STEM education, jobs, and entrepreneurship, especially in leadership positions. Gender stereotypes and systemic barriers continue to turn women and girls away from pursuing education and jobs in STEM, perpetuating a cycle of inequality in accessing the jobs of today and the future. The transition to a green economy, marked by global commitments to more sustainable practices and net-zero targets, has catalyzed the demand for “green jobs” which are becoming increasingly critical in the labor market. The full potential of this transition can only be realized when gender disparities in STEM fields are addressed, ensuring that women and girls have equal access to opportunities that contribute to and beenfot from the green economy.

Prioritized interventions included support to protect productive assets and inputs, as well as grants for business creation and recovery. Through the Poverty Alleviation Coalition, poverty reduction programmes were supported and access to employment, entrepreneurship, and agricultural activities was facilitated. The Office continued building partnerships to promote development-oriented and evidence-based livelihood programming, while advocating for the economic inclusion of the forcibly displaced in government economic relief plans and social services. 4. With the aim of advancing economic inclusion, UNHCR worked with financial service providers, promoting greater support for refugees in the current challenging context. The Office strengthened its partnership with the non-profit organization Kiva, which has provided risk-tolerant funding to over 27,000 refugees since 2016 through 20 local partners, with a loan repayment rate of 95.5 per cent. MADE51, UNHCR’s flagship initiative which connects refugee-made products with markets, was expanded to 23 countries, engaging 30 local social enterprises to create employment for over 3,000 refugee artisans.

To this end, UNHCR worked with governments and development actors in fostering opportunities to include displaced populations in existing social protection programmes. For example, with funding from the World Bank’s International Development Association (IDA 18 and 19), 14 projects are enhancing access of refugees to social safety nets in low-income countries. Furthermore, additional funding has been channelled through the projects as part of the COVID-19 response and recovery efforts. B. Social protection 6. The disproportionate impact of COVID-19 on displaced persons and the widespread use of social protection programmes as a government response increased the urgency for UNHCR to engage in social protection systems. In 2020 and 2021, UNHCR carried out four studies on inclusion in systems that covered the COVID-19 social protection responses; inclusion in social protection systems in Europe and Africa; and the World Bank IDA18 EC/73/SC/CRP.3 4 regional sub-window funded social protection projects. These studies have shown how transitioning from assistance to inclusion in government social protection systems contributes to protection and pathways to solutions, particularly for refugees in contexts of protracted displacement. They also demonstrated that an area-based approach to scaling up coverage for host and refugee populations and the adjustment of project design and rollout to meet the specific needs and harness the capacities of refugees are all important aspects to fostering inclusion. 7.",244,True,False,True,False,0.0

Building on these studies, UNHCR has developed a “Roadmap for inclusion of persons of concern in social protection systems (2022-2025)”. Such efforts, will continue to help governments and development actors open windows of inclusion in existing policy and programmes, align assistance and support the access of persons of concern to these programmes. The roadmap also aims at guiding coherent action by all stakeholders through a government-led transition action plan. Throughout 2021, UNHCR has worked with the World Bank to provide support to governments in the design and rollout of IDA18 regional sub-window and IDA19 window for refugees and host communities social protection projects in Burundi, Cameroon, Chad, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Djibouti, Ethiopia, Mauritania and the Republic of the Congo. For example, UNHCR together with the Ministry for Social and Family Affairs and the World Bank in Mauritania supported the enrolment of 14,000 refugee households to the national social registry, 6,000 households for social assistance cash transfers, while targeting 4,500 vulnerable households for a COVID-19 response through the Asian Development Bank.

C. Cash-based interventions 8. Throughout 2021, UNHCR delivered some $670 million in over 100 countries including in challenging emergencies involving countries such as Afghanistan, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the Islamic Republic of Iran and Yemen. Cash remains an efficient tool to respond to immediate life-saving needs, as well as a key approach to fostering resilience and unlocking the potential for sustainable inclusion for persons of concern. 9. Over the course of the year, post-distribution monitoring using UNHCR’s corporate tool was conducted in 60 countries. The global Post Distribution Monitoring report concluded that cash assistance was effective in responding to people’s needs and helping to improve their overall well-being. Markets largely remained functional despite the global challenges posed by the pandemic, and cash was the preferred assistance modality. Some 95 per cent of the respondents reported that cash assistance had improved their living conditions and helped reduce feelings of stress. 10. In line with the Global Compact on Refugees, 6 million persons of concern benefitted from digital payments in 48 countries. Some 25 per cent had access to fully owned bank accounts or mobile money accounts, which is a pathway towards financial inclusion.

The Accelerated Education Working Group leveraged UNHCR’s expertise in accelerated learning initiatives, such as sharing detailed guidance to countries wishing to condense their curriculum in order to make up for teaching time lost during COVID. Guidance was provided in response to the COVID-19 pandemic for donors, implementers, and education systems with a view to helping learners catch up when schools re-open. 15. Building on lessons learned from school closures related to COVID-19, UNHCR worked to increase the digital inclusion of refugees through connected education initiatives, including through the launch of the Refugee Connected Education Challenge. In addition, UNHCR worked with the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) to establish shared digital learning principles to encourage greater coherence and meaningful inclusion across education programmes of partners.

In 2021, UNHCR increased its engagement in inter-agency coordination efforts on global nutrition and food security and participated in the United Nations Food Systems Summit at the United Nations General Assembly. At the national level, the Office advocated for the inclusion of forcibly displaced populations in country action plans to address child wasting. 17. To improve food security and protection for refugees, UNHCR expanded its operational collaboration with the World Food Programme (WFP) at country and global levels, including through the Joint Programme Excellence and Targeting Hub. Based on country requests, the hub provided technical and programmatic support in Cameroon, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Jordan, Mauritania, Mozambique, Rwanda, Uganda and Zambia to assess needs and vulnerabilities; design protection-sensitive strategies for targeting and prioritizing assistance to meet food and other basic needs; and develop joint plans for greater refugee self-reliance. However, persistent gaps in funding for food and other basic assistance remained a key challenge, significantly affecting the ability of refugees to meet their basic needs and increasing protection risks.

This total is then divided by the household's equivalized size, as calculated by the modified OECD scale. 9 EUROSTAT (2023), Methodological Guidelines and Description of EU-SILC Target Variables, https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/documents/203647/20298610/Methodological+guidelines+2023+operation_v6-accessibility.pdf/2d6aa68c- aa51-d386-1f1c-0206fda5be49?t=1730709878443 10 UN Special Rapporteur on the Right to Development (2023), Report on the visit to Albania, July, 2023, https://undocs.org/Home/Mobile?FinalSymbol=A%2FHRC%2F54%2F27%2FAdd.1&Language=E&DeviceType=Desktop&LangRequested=Fal se 11 Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination (CERD) 2024, Concluding observations on the combined thirteenth and fourteenth periodic reports of Albania, 23 May 2024, https://undocs.org/Home/Mobile?FinalSymbol=CERD%2FC%2FALB%2FCO%2F13- 14&Language=E&DeviceType=Desktop&LangRequested=False 12 UN Special Rapporteur on the Right to Development (2023), Report on the visit to Albania, July, 2023, https://undocs.org/Home/Mobile?FinalSymbol=A%2FHRC%2F54%2F27%2FAdd.1&Language=E&DeviceType=Desktop&LangRequested=Fal se ALBANIA COUNTRY GENDER EQUALITY PROFILE 2025 3 incorporated the principle of intersectionality in its NSGE 2021-2030, where it prioritizes, young women and girls, in all their diversity13, at the center of the Strategies’ measures and actions.

Several policy documents have been developed on social protection and inclusion of specific disadvantaged groups.15 The overall social protection scheme includes social insurance16, employment and labor market programs17.

Moreover, children are at the heart of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which serve as a blueprint for achieving inclusive economic, social, and environmental progress. The realization of child rights and the SDGs are inextricably linked and mutually reinforcing: the CRC outlines the rights that governments must respect, protect, and fulfil for all children, while the SDGs provide a universal, time-bound framework to end poverty, protect the planet, and promote peace and prosperity for all. (UNICEF, 2020) To support the Government of Albania’s efforts to realize children’s rights and achieve the SDGs, UNICEF, in collaboration with the Ministry of Finance and Economy, initiated an analysis of public spending on children. Using the Child-focused Public Expenditure Measurement (C-PEM) methodology-an innovative tool developed by UNICEF-this analysis informed policy recommendations to enhance the alignment of government budgets with commitments to children’s rights.

Why measure public expenditure on children? a) To increase the effectiveness of policies for children Enhancing the visibility of children in public budgets is crucial to improving the effectiveness of policies and programs that promote children’s rights and well-being. Greater awareness of the importance of investing in children can influence decision-making and resource allocation, thereby elevating the priority afforded to childhood in public policies. The situation of children in Albania underscores the urgent need for increased and improved public spending on children. With a population of 2.8 million, of which approximately 23% (640,000) are children under the age of 18, children remain the most vulnerable age group in the country. In 2021, 28.5% of children were at risk of poverty, compared to 21.8% of adults aged 18-64 (EU SILC 2021). Income inequality and disparities in access to services and education persist as strategic challenges, limiting equity and opportunity for Albanian children.",243,True,True,True,False,0.0

Child Responsive Public Finance Developing Budget Markers for Child Allocations in Albania 7 Many European countries have introduced child-specific benefit systems, which have proven effective in reducing child poverty, improving family living standards, and enhancing child well- being. Albania is encouraged to explore the adoption of similar systems to support families with children. Increasing and improving the performance of public spending on children and adolescents also facilitates better evaluation of the impact of public expenditures and helps identify bottlenecks and barriers. This promotes efficiency and effectiveness in public spending. Public expenditure on basic social services such as education, healthcare, housing, and infrastructure are key indicators of social development, underscoring the rationale for prioritizing child- responsive budgeting. Investments in early childhood, when brain development is most rapid, have the greatest impact on cognitive and non-cognitive skills, forming the foundation for later achievements and determining the productivity of future investments in children and young adults. Equitable investment in all children fosters a more inclusive society and enhances the potential of tomorrow’s adults to contribute to Albania’s development. b) To strengthen implementation of public financial management principles towards child rights commitments Child-responsive budgeting is a vital mechanism to ensure accountability in translating commitments related to children into public budgets.",247,True,True,True,False,0.0

Results-based budgeting can align strategic planning with public finance management processes by directly linking strategic objectives to public spending. Additionally, child budget analysis enhances our understanding of the varying needs of children, youth, and adults, as well as the distributional effects and impacts of budget resources on these groups. This analysis provides a foundation for more effective and inclusive resource allocation, helping to address real needs, bridge gaps, and reduce inequalities. Furthermore, tracking public expenditure on children can significantly improve transparency and participation in budget processes. By monitoring the government’s financial efforts to support children, it fosters accountability and systematizes reporting on spending related to child rights. This is particularly critical in fulfilling obligations under Article 4 of the CRC, which calls for governments to allocate resources to the maximum extent possible to uphold children’s rights. Conducting the Child Budget Tagging Exercise Child budget tagging is a government-led process for identifying, measuring, and monitoring public expenditures relevant to children.

Regarding coverage, the analysis includes both central and local government recurrent and investment budgets.

This report underscores the urgency to take appropriate measures that provide unaccompanied and/ or separated children seeking refuge with the protection and humanitarian assistance they deserve. Unaccompanied and separated children arriv- ing in Albania deserve to be placed within the national/local alternative care system, prefera- bly in family-type care, which can offer them the safety and dignity that all children are entitled, in both law and practice. Upholding international standards is paramount, which includes pro- viding guardians, social workers, individualized best interest assessments, education, child par- ticipation, information, integration-related mea- sures, psycho-social and mental health support, health care, leisure, family tracing and reunifica- tion, and specialized services. This report highlights the increasing phenom- enon of human trafficking in unaccompanied and missing children within the European Union. Unaccompanied children and those separated from their families face multifac- eted challenges and risks as they navigate through a foreign and unfamiliar environ- ment. In response, both national and inter- national institutions have made efforts to re- form their legal frameworks to prevent such risks and protect children effectively.

We must work together to bridge the gaps in our child protection systems, in the best interest of the most vulnerable among us. It is only through our collective efforts and unwavering commitment to protecting these children that we can ensure their safety, dig- nity, and well-being. Together, we can build a brighter and more secure future for all chil- dren, leaving no child behind. Thank you for your dedication to this important cause.

The chal- lenges and serious risks children are exposed to as a result of such criminal activities, partic- ularly unaccompanied children and those separated from the family due to different causes, are multifaceted. In view of this, national and international institutions have intensified their efforts to reform their legal frameworks in order to prevent the risks and protect children.",249,True,False,False,False,0.0

In view of this, national and international institutions have intensified their efforts to reform their legal frameworks in order to prevent the risks and protect children. In recent years, Albania has been affected by migration flows, as evidenced by the number of unaccompanied and separated foreign children entering Albania to remain in the country or transit to a EU country. Foreign bodies’ reports highlight shortcomings with respect to the procedures followed in cases of unaccompanied foreign children, such as the procedure for managing the cases of unaccompanied children, identification of persons with specific needs, return procedures, etc. Generally, all reports recommend continuing addressing the phenom- enon of unaccompanied children, strengthening efforts with regard to the prevention of child trafficking by way of specific provisions in the institutional framework and policies against trafficking in human beings to prevent and combat the phenomenon, as well as to assist and protect victims of trafficking in human beings. In addition, even empirical field observations by local organizations, have identified sensitive issues regarding the lacking national frame- work and institutional capacities in terms of addressing the international standards on the protection of unaccompanied and separated children.",224,False,False,False,False,0.0

As a result, the identification of gaps or non-compliances of the legal framework with international standards, structures and institu- tional capacities, as well as the practical difficulties in implementing the legislation in Albania, is critical. In order to address the aforementioned need, the Assessment of the legal framework in Alba- nia aims to provide an analysis of the fitness of the applicable rules, as well as the shortcom- ings of local institutional capacities regarding the protection of unaccompanied and separat- ed foreign children, as a highly vulnerable category that is also at risk of trafficking. The main objectives include the following: Ô Review of the legal framework and national procedures in terms of their compliance with the international and regional law on the protection of unaccompanied and separated children, including, inter alia, the exercise of parental responsibility, custody, protective measures, and procedures followed for their accomplishment.",240,False,False,False,False,0.0

Në këtë rrugëtim, ka pasur një rëndësi të posaçme mbështetja nga Programi i OKB-së, “Përmirësimi i ofrimit të shërbimeve lokale të mbrojtjes sociale”, i financuar nga Fondi i Përbashkët i Kombeve të Bashkuara për Objektivat e Zhvillimit të Qëndrueshëm dhe i zbatuar nga qeveria shqiptare, në bashkëpunim me katër agjencitë e OKB-së, PNUD-i, UNICEF-i, UN Women dhe OBSh-ja, me pjesëmarrjen e UNFPA-së dhe ILO-s, si dhe mbështetja nga Programi i Përbashkët i Kombeve të Bashkuara, “Leave No One Behind” (Askush të mos mbetet pas). Zbatimi i agjendës transformuese të shërbimeve shoqërore kërkon domosdoshmërisht struktura institucionale funksionale në të gjitha nivelet, me burime njerëzore jo vetëm të mjaftueshme për t’iu përgjigjur detyrimeve ligjore të tyre, por edhe të mirëtrajnuara, për të përballuar të gjitha sfidat me të cilat ndeshen.

While Alba- nia’s labor market had been trending in a positive direction, evidenced by increased employment and female labor force participation, the employment increases were largely in low wage sectors and due to a rise in informal employment. Albania imple- mented a policy package with broad measures to mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 crisis on the poor and vulnerable and on the broader economy, yet the pandemic is expected to result in a signifi- cant development setback. Across Albanian society, key demographic groups are falling behind. Poverty and economic develop- ment continue to differ widely across regions, with the central and northern regions having higher poverty rates, a significantly lower share in economic activity and lower employment rates than the rest of the country.

Important gender gaps also persist. For example, the female employment rate is 13 percentage points lower than the male employment rate, and the average gender pay gap is 10 percent.1 To reduce the incidence of poverty, measures to create more job opportunities for all Albanians must be complemented by an effective social protection framework. Social protection is essential to protect people from falling into poverty and destitution; to help people cope with adverse idiosyncratic or systemic shocks and smooth consumption over their lifetime; and to promote human capital accumula- tion and ensure better access to jobs. Social protec- tion comprises a variety of policy tools, including cash transfers to the poor and persons with disa- bilities, social services for vulnerable populations, labor market programs and unemployment insur- ance, and old-age pensions. While each benefit or service addresses a specific need against which its performance is often assessed, it is also important to analyze whether the system as a whole fulfills its objectives. Conceptually, social protection systems rest on four main pillars: social assistance, social services, social insurance and labor market programs.

Social assis- tance generally aims to protect people from falling into poverty and provide support at certain points in the life cycle or respond to particular vulnerabil- ities. It encompasses non-contributory programs (that is, government funded), including non-con- tributory pensions (often called social pensions), and family- and child-related cash benefits. Social services support individuals and their families to improve their living conditions when facing various risks throughout the life cycle, such as children, adolescents and elderly people, and persons with disabilities. Social insurance aims to smooth income across the life cycle and protect people from shocks and typically comprises benefits based on indi- vidual contributions (that is, old-age pensions, disa- bility pensions and survivors’ pensions); individuals who contribute to these programs are entitled to benefits, usually based on the length and level of their contribution. Finally, employment and labor market programs aim to improve the functioning of the labor market (through employment services), to enhance labor supply (through training) and to increase labor demand (through subsidies or public works); they also seek to smooth income during unemployment (through unemployment insurance) or to protect employment due to childbirth (through parental benefits).

Are the funds allocated to each program used effec- tively or are there ways to improve impacts for equal levels of spending?

To be sure, thoroughly addressing all these aspects would require a multitude of exhaustive assessments and falls beyond the purpose of this review.

The analysis finds that Albania has implemented important reforms of the social protection system in the past years to improve the effectiveness and equity in the system. While some of these reforms are beginning to bear fruit, others must be sustained and furthered to achieve the intended results. Spending on social protection in Albania has risen steadily. This trend is largely driven by expenditures on social insurance, while spending on social assis- tance is low and that on labor market programs and social services very low. A range of recent reforms provide a solid foundation to improve the effective- ness of the entire social protection system in the upcoming years, although concerns with the equity, balance and sustainability remain. Reforms of the last resort income support program, the Ndihma Ekonomike, have improved its targeting and the application and delivery of benefits, although the adequacy of the benefit has eroded in recent years.

Women’s economic empowerment is key for growth both through the direct impact of the size of the labor force on output and the impact on productivity (Cuberes and Teignier 2016) and through higher domestic demand. In addition, the International Labour Organization estimates that reducing the gender gap in labour market participation by 25% could boost global GDP 3.9 % (ILO 2017). Fiscal policy is a powerful tool to close gender gaps. In advanced economies, childcare subsidies, paid parental leave, and a shift from household to individual tax filing have been used to encourage female labor force participation (Andresen and Havnes 2019; Bick and Fuchs-Schündeln 2017; Gelbach 2002; Kalb 2018; Christiansen and others 2016b, c). In developing economies, investing in female education and in infrastructure (including electricity, roads, water and sanitation) that reduces the time women spend on household production has yielded positive results in terms of female labor force participation (Cubas 2016; Dinkelman 2011; Ilahi and Grimard 2000; Jain Chandra and others 2018). Cash transfers are also shown to have a positive effect on female labor force participation1. 1.1 Methodology The country analysis on expenditures and fiscal space including gender and child sensitive budgeting (public expenditure) in Albania is a qualitative study completed using the data from labour force surveys, published reports and COVID-19 assessment report, other equivalent survey reports, administrative information, and household survey data, and in close collaboration with the Ministry of Finance and Economy and the INSTAT.",250,True,True,True,False,0.0

The study will have two key dimensions: a gender sensitive vulnerability analysis from unpaid care and child development perspective, and based on findings, moving towards enabling a fiscal policy reform to address economic losses from unpaid care work as well as children development and well-being. Therefore, this analysis aims to shed light on the scope of gender responsive fiscal policies to address gender and child sensitive socio-economic vulnerabilities.

This provides essential information for policymakers that intends to adopt gender sensitive fiscal policy measures to empower women economically and, at the same time, tackle other economic and social priorities. Data analysis The report covers a wide array of subjects and provides comprehensive information on the socioeconomic status vis-à-vis public expenditure of Albania. This analysis builds a profile of the status of gender centered poverty and vulnerability in Albania based on their unpaid care and builds a profile of the status of gender centered poverty and vulnerability. The analysis discusses income and non-income dimensions of well-being in Albania. While the focus is to understand the situation of the least well-off sections of the population (gender based and children), the analysis provides valuable information on the overall level of wealth and wellbeing for the whole of Albania. The analysis presents poverty and inequality figures at the national level because of the unpaid care work. 8 EXPENDITURES AND FISCAL SPACE ANALYSIS INCLUDING GENDER AND CHILD SENSITIVE BUDGETING IN ALBANIA 2.

Gender and child sensitive socio-economic vulnerabilities in Albania Albania is an upper middle-income country. Albania’s economy grew by an average of 2.4 % over the past decade. The economy is dominated by the services sector, especially tourism, followed by agriculture, industry and construction. According to the Human Development Report 2019, Albania ranks 69th out of 189 countries and territories, with a Human Development Index (HDI) of 0.791. Despite the progress made, Albania is still one of the poorest countries in Europe, with an at-risk-of poverty rate of 23.4 % in 2018 (average of EU 28 countries, 16.9%). The national minimum wage is US$ 232 and the average, US$ 470 (31% of the EU average). Vulnerability, inequality, and social services In Albania, almost 40% of households are materially deprived, and 23.4% of the population is at risk of poverty2. Many regions and groups, such as Roma and Egyptians, have limited access to infrastructure. Family responsibilities, and lack of access to child care prevent women’s equal participation in the formal labour market. While many promising social protection reforms have recently been undertaken, social assistance benefits are too modest and not integrated with care services. The Gender Equality Index in the Republic of Albania scores 60.4 points and it is seven points lower than EU-28 average.",228,True,True,True,False,0.0

The Gender Equality Index in the Republic of Albania scores 60.4 points and it is seven points lower than EU-28 average. Albania’s Gender Equality Indices indicate that 51.1 % of women are engaged in caring for children or grandchildren, older people or people with disabilities every day, in comparison with 24.6 % of men.3 However, Gender Equality Index shows that one of the important structural inequality is related to the gender segregation both in the domains of knowledge and work. 2.1 Poverty Though Albania has not announced an official poverty line hence the measurement of poverty has not been consistent over time due to the recent change of the definition of poverty. Table 1 summarizes the poverty situation in Albania based on the Income and Living Conditions Survey in 2017, 2018 and 2019. It indicates the percentage of persons living in households where equivalent disposable income is below the at-risk-of- poverty threshold. The at-risk-of-poverty threshold is defined as 60 % of the median equivalized disposable income and adjusted by the equivalent scale of household structure4. 2. OECD 2019. 3.

To achieve this, the Strategy promotes a multisectoral approach, working in partnership with communities and key stakeholders both within, and external to, UNHCR. The right to health also requires that health services are equitable so that they are available, accessible and adapted to meet the needs of all persons, with particular attention to at-risk groups, in accordance with UNHCR’s Age, Gender and Diversity (AGD) policy.",240,True,False,True,True,0.0

This can be achieved through comprehensive responses which entail rapid and well-supported reception and admissions, support for immediate and ongoing needs including health, assistance for local and national institutions and communities receiving refugees, as well as expanded opportunities for solutions. Within the context of the GCR, UNHCR’s support to Public Health services will differ according to the context and phase of displacement namely emergency, post-emergency and protracted situations.

To date, macroeconomic policies in Albania have paid scant attention to these issues and have therefore not been conducive to the achievement of gender equality. Participation and consultation are still limited when it comes to the gender-responsive allocation of funds for social protection in the country’s budget. The priorities of women, especially unpaid care and children’s lifelong development, are not fully reflected in the way finances are actually allocated and used.

Introduction Albania is divided in many ways. Wealth, education, urban and rural habitat, sex, age, family-based groups, political affiliations, ethnicity and other criteria differentiate Albanians. The access of individuals and groups to economic, social and political re- sources is deeply unequal. Attention and support are required to facilitate the inclusion of specific populations: the marginalized and vulnerable, the poor, and, as important parts of these groups, the Roma and Egyptians and persons with disabilities. Gender inequality is one of the greatest challenges facing Albanian policymakers trying to achieve faster, more sustainable, and more inclusive growth.

Gender budgeting has enjoyed continued support for the past several years. Also, there are visible efforts from civil society to provide expert gender analysis and to broaden the debate on fiscal policy by demonstrating that gender budgeting contributes to good outcomes for women and children, especially the social and economic benefits of women’s equality and economic empowerment. However, spending on gender equality in Albania is modest at 0.05 per cent of its GDP. • In Albania, the distribution of care responsibilities is incredibly unequal, falling mainly on households and being carried out mostly by women as unpaid work. • Unpaid work accounts for roughly 60% of GDP in Albania1. The value of this labour is US$84 (EUR 71) based on an average monthly salary of US$390 (EUR 330), and taking into consideration that 35% of the approx- imate 1.08 million women in Albania are employed, this equates to the Albanian economy missing out on a potential US$ 32 (EUR 27) million every single month2. A staggering US$ 385 (EUR 324) million a year. • Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, women dedicated substantially more hours (21.74% of the day) than men to unpaid work. • Informal employment accounts for about 61% of total employment in Albania. • Despite its importance, this work continues to lack visibility and is underestimated and disregarded in the design of macroeconomic and social policies.",249,True,True,False,False,0.0

Albania’s social care and protection systems insufficiently defend people against poverty shocks and struggle to help women and girls find sustainably productive pathways. Investments in education, health care and social protection as a share of GDP are below EU averages. 1. IMF Working Paper 2019. 2. Ibid.

Though Albania has progressed in terms of social protection, further strides must be made in relation to gen- der equality and children’s rights. A relative lack of funding has resulted in the poor availability and quality of public social services and low levels of social protection benefits.

Investments in social protection should be grounded in domestic public financing. Key findings Public investment in care sectors can create and support job creation in both the care sector and in the wid- er economy as care workers expand their consumption. In Albania, there is a potential to expand thousand jobs (child care, and home health cares) by every 10 million EURO) public investment in a care infrastructure. However, future economic research is needed to quantify the effect of increased caregiving because of public investment. Investing in care work including child care would catalyze multiple positive effects: stabilizing care for women households (parents) - predominantly mothers - in the paid labor force who have been deeply impacted by the sudden lack of child care; ensuring employment stability for the critical child care workforce; and creating employment opportunities for unpaid women. Investing in a social care infrastructure is unambiguously an urgent national priority.

This analysis finds that a public investment in care sectors can support millions of jobs in paid care work and beyond. A robust investment in care would have important knock-on effects, including creating additional indirect jobs in related sectors for women and girls. 8 FINANCING A SOCIAL PROTECTION FLOOR FOR VULNERABLE WOMEN, GIRLS AND CHILDREN IN ALBANIA POLICY BRIEF Social protection financing, gender equality and expenditure In Albania, social protection spending is significantly lower than the EU average, although it more than dou- bled between 2005 and 2016. In 2016, Albania spent 9.4 per cent of its GDP on social protection, which is much lower than the European average of 28 per cent. Expenditure in the sector is dominated by social in- surance outlays, which account on average for over 75 per cent of total spending, and non-contributory cash programmes targeting poverty and disability. The social protection system provides coverage to almost half of the population. Spending levels, however, remain low due to the very modest size of pensions and poverty cash benefits. Government revenue finances more than half of social protection spending. The fiscal revenue structure relies heavily on indirect consumption taxes. The Albanian fiscal system has contributed to reducing inequalities; however, moderate poverty exists.",246,True,False,True,False,0.0

The Albanian fiscal system has contributed to reducing inequalities; however, moderate poverty exists. In Albania, as in other countries, women and men tend to have different economic roles and responsibilities. Also, their access to productive resources is different. As a result, in most cases, women are at a disadvan- tage. For example, women are usually expected to take on the bulk of caring for their families. This means that women (much more than men) have the double burden of performing both paid and unpaid work. This dual role often undermines women’s access to the paid labour market and other economic opportunities. In addition, it means they can only access a limited range of sectors and occupations. This double burden is also likely to make women more vulnerable within their own households, leading to negative effects on children and their development. This situation has been exacerbated by shocks like the COVID-19 pandemic. Weaknesses in the effectiveness of gender-sensitive public expenditure can be observed in funding allocation and policy decisions, including the amount of budget share earmarked for gender equality associated with issues like unpaid care work. In particular, Albania’s gender budgeting has not been able to stimulate the adoption of policy changes to improve care systems, including those for child development, specifically in the areas of: • Education, • The labour market to address unpaid care work, • Income inequality, • Welfare, • Childcare and family care, and • Health.",249,True,False,False,False,0.0

As unpaid care work is pervasive in Albania and became more widespread during the pandemic, there is a real need to invest in and promote gender equality to safeguard the rights of women and girls. Gender-sensitive social protection can address such inequalities and enhance children’s well-being and development by: a) recognizing, reducing and redistributing women’s care work, b) expanding gender-responsive services to reduce care burdens and increase employment oppor- tunities and c) increasing men’s contribution to unpaid care",225,True,False,False,True,0.0

Key messages Importance of introducing child-benefits All EU countries support family incomes through a combination of statutory minimum wages, in-work child benefits, and the provision of basic health and education services free of charge (Bradshaw and Hirose, 2016). In most EU countries, the child benefit package includes a universal cash or tax benefit element, which is paid to all families with children irrespective of their earnings level. All OECD countries have a child benefit except Turkey and child benefits have been developed in all the Western Balkan Countries - except Albania. In Albania there are no child or family benefits other than a one-time bonus payment at birth and the “Ndihma Ekonomike” (cash assistance) programme targeting poor households. Child benefits are one way that the state contributes to the costs borne by parents in raising children. In most countries they make a powerful contribution to reducing child poverty, improving the living standards of families and enhancing child wellbeing. They may also perform other important functions: they recognise the rights of a child as enjoined on governments by the UN Convention; they provide some security in times of family disruption or unemployment; they enhance incentives to work because they are paid independently of employment status; and they might play a part in reducing the rapid decline in fertility Albania is experiencing.",240,True,False,True,False,0.0

If a child benefit had been in place of ALL 42,000 per year per child the child poverty rate would have been 19.7% - a reduction of 31%. If a child benefit had been in place of ALL 50,000 per year the child poverty rate would have been 18.2% - a reduction of 36%. If the child benefit were gradually scaled up over time starting with the 0-5 age group in the first year it would reduce child poverty from 25.4% for that age group to 20.2% at ALL 42,000 per child and to 19.4% at ALL 50,000 per child. 1. Introduction and scope of report The case for introducing a child benefit programme is to contribute to reducing child poverty, both monetary and non-monetary.

The document is expected to help open discussions on the need to introduce child-specific policies to support realisation of child rights, and their dignity as well as help reduce child poverty. The paper develops a set of options for the introduction of child benefits, presenting potential advantages and disadvantaged, based on evidence from other countries and analysis of the local context.

Ndihma Ekonomike (NE), as the only standalone poverty alleviation programme in the country, cannot improve child well-being. The NE programme provides modest top-ups to the poverty cash benefits in the form of cash conditional transfers for child enrolment in compulsory education (ALL 300 or €2.6 per child month during the school year) and vaccination (ALL 100 or €0.8 per child per each vaccine), as a measure to ensure inclusivity for certain vulnerable categories. Furthermore, it is unclear whether it has any impact on a child's well-being. The level of these top-up benefits for children is very low and the level of benefits has remained unchanged despite the changing context and living standards. Social assistance (minimum income) in Albania is a non-contributory scheme covering individuals/households most in need of support. The Law 57/2019 on social assistance distinguishes between two main groups of social assistance beneficiaries: a) those falling under one of the “special categories” of individuals/ households in need, as identified by this law 57/2019 (e.g. children in foster care, orphan children not in institutions, households with triplets or more (i.e.",222,True,False,True,False,0.0

The scheme is based on a means-testing assessment, and individuals/households are eligible even if they have other sources of income such as benefits from other social protection schemes (pensions, disability benefits etc. ), paid employment or income from household agricultural activity. The social assistance benefit is estimated on a household level based on the instruction of the minister of 2014 which sets the monthly benefits at ALL 1,800 (€17) per month for the head of the family, ALL 1,260 (€10.5) for other adult members and ALL 900 (€ 7.5) for minor family members.

Due to the urgency and unpredictability of both the damages and the social, economic and health consequences caused by the COVID-19 pandemic crisis, it was impossible to conduct in-depth analysis of the impact of financial measures on men and women. These measures to mitigate the crisis consequences are based only on the data available at the time of their preparation. Important measures have been undertaken for the advancement of gender equality in the following fields: employment; reducing and redistributing unpaid care and unpaid work at home; narrowing differences between the genders in the digital field; promoting employment and supporting start-ups, women’s enterprises; social protection including special measures for mother and child protection; the expansion of social care services and specialized support services; improving health outcomes and increasing information on sexual and reproductive health, etc.",206,True,False,True,False,0.0

For example, the fact that many women in agriculture do not have equal rights on ownership of property and assets, partly due to patriarchal practices of land inheritance, affects the achievement of appropriate results in terms of their economic empowerment.

So, there are precisely such aspects of intersectionality that draw attention to the need for more in-depth gender analysis and measures that must be undertaken in conformity with the specific needs of these groups, in every field. Positive trends in employment rates and participation of women/young women in the labor market were interrupted by COVID-19, leading to job losses and decrease of number of labor force. Therefore, immediately after overcoming the emergency situation, the Government of Albania took measures to address unemployment, especially among young people. The Youth Guarantee Program aimed at including in the labor market of young people not in education, employment, vocational training, increasing the level of the minimum wage, reducing the gender gap in wages, or engaging in Global 6 Accelerator for Decent Work and Social Protection for Just Transitions, aiming at creating jobs and the development of skills in the main sectors of the environmental economy and digitalization, etc., are some of the concrete examples of measures undertaken to progress towards inclusive development, shared prosperity and decent work.
